<h2>AN EPISTLE DEDICATORY</h2>


<p>
<span class="smcap">My dear Will Ranstead</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, in our too infrequent talks,
I have confessed my growing fondness for
life in London, your kindly countenance
has assumed an expression so piteous that
my Conscience has turned upon what I am
pleased to call my Mind, to demand explanation
of a feeling so distressing to so
excellent a friend.</p>

<p>My Mind, at first, was disposed to
apologise. It pleaded its notoriously easy-going
character: it had never met man or
woman that it had not more or less admired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
nor remained long anywhere without coming
to strike kinship with the people and to
develop pride in their activities.</p>

<p>In its infancy it had been as Badisch
as the Grossherzog of Baden, and had
deemed lilac-scented Carlsruhe the grandest
town in the world.</p>

<p>In blue-and-white Lutetia, it had grown
as Parisian as an English dramatist.</p>

<p>When the fickle Fates moved it on to
Manchester, it had learned in a little while
to ogle Gaythorn and Oldham Road as
enchanted Titania ogled her gentle joy, the
loathly Bottom. It had looked with scorn
on the returned prodigals who had been to
London&mdash;"to tahn," they called it&mdash;and who
came back to their more or less marble
halls in Salford with trousers turned up round
the hems, shepherds' crooks to support
their elegantly languid totter, and words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
withering scorn for the streets of Peter and
Oxford, which my Mind had learned to
regard as boulevards of dazzling light.</p>

<p>Mine had always been a pliant and affable
mind. Perhaps if it lived in Widnes it
might prefer it to Heaven.</p>

<p>But the longer I remained in London
the more convinced I became that never
again should I like Widnes, or Manchester,
or Paris, or Carlsruhe, as well as this
tantalising, fascinating, baffling city of misty
light&mdash;this stately, monstrous, grey, grimy,
magnificent London.</p>

<p>Then I sought reason for my state, and
the following papers&mdash;one or two contributed
to the <cite>Liverpool Post</cite>, one to the
<cite>Clarion</cite>, and the most part printed now
for the first time&mdash;are the result of my
inquiries.</p>

<p>One day I found cause for liking London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
another day the reverse. As the reasons
came to me I wrote them down, and with
all their inconsistencies upon their heads,
you have them here collected.</p>

<p>I have addressed the papers to you,
because:&mdash;</p>

<p>As you had inspired the book, it was
only fair you should share the blame.</p>

<p>By answering you publicly, I saved myself
the trouble of separately answering many
other country friends who likewise looked
upon my love of London as a deplorable
falling from grace.</p>

<p>Thirdly, by this means, I save postages,
and may actually induce a few adventurous
moneyed persons to pay me for the
work.</p>

<p>Lastly, and most seriously, I lay hold on
this occasion to publish the respect and
gratitude I owe to you, and which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
repay to the best of my ability by this
small token of my friendship.&mdash;Sincerely
yours,</p>

<p class="sig">
ALEX. M. THOMPSON.
</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You will naturally wonder after
reading the book&mdash;should you be spared
so long&mdash;why I call it <cite>Haunts of Old
Cockaigne</cite>.</p>

<p>I may say at once that you are fully
entitled to wonder.</p>

<p>It is included in the price.</p>

<h2>LONDON'S ENCHANTMENT</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I want the hum of my working brothers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">London bustle and London strife.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">H. S. Leigh.</span>
</p>


<p>Let them that desire "solitary to wander
o'er the russet mead" put on their clump
boots and wander.</p>

<p>I prefer the Strand.</p>

<p>The Poet's customary meadow with its
munching sheep and æsthetic cow, his
pleasing daisies and sublimated dandelions,
his ecstatic duck and blooming plum tree,
are all very well in their way; but there is
more human interest in Seven Dials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The virtuous man who on the sunless side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a romantic mountain, forest crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits coolly calm; while all the world without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsatisfied, and sick, tosses at noon&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">may have a very good time if his self-satisfaction
suffice to shelter him from Boredom;
but of what use is he to the world or to his
fellow-creatures?</p>

<p>I have no patience with the long-haired
persons whose scorn of the common people's
drudgery finds vent in lofty exhortations to
"fly the rank city, shun the turbid air,
breathe not the chaos of eternal smoke, and
volatile corruption."</p>

<p>By turning his back to "the tumult of a
guilty world," and "through the verdant
maze of sweetbriar hedges, pursue his devious
walk," the Poet provides no remedy for the
sin and suffering of human cities&mdash;especially
if the Poet finds it inconvenient to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
soulful rapture to attend to his own
washing.</p>

<p>It offends me to the soul to hear robustious,
bladder-pated, tortured Bunthornes
crying out for "boundless contiguity of
shade" where they can hear themselves
think, when they might be digging the soil
or fixing gaspipes.</p>

<p>I would have such fellows banished to
remote solitudes, where they should prove
their disdain of the grovelling herd by
learning to do without them. I would have
them fed, clothed, nursed, caressed, and
entertained solely by their own sufficiency.
Let them enjoy <em>themselves</em>.</p>

<p>Erycina's doves, they sing, and ancient
stream of Simois!</p>

<p>I sing the common people, and the vulgar
London streets&mdash;streams of life, action, and
passion, whose every drop is a human soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
each drop distinct and different, each
coloured by his or her own wonderful
personality.</p>

<p>I never grow tired of seeing them, admiring
them, wondering about them.</p>

<p>Beneath this turban what anxieties?
Beneath yon burnoose what heartaches and
desires? Under all this sartorial medley of
frock-coats, jackets, mantles, capes, cloth,
silk, satins, rags, what truth? what meaning?
what purport? How to get at the hearts
of them? how to evolve the best of them?
how to blot out their passions, spites, and
rancours, and get at their human kinship and
brotherhood?</p>

<p>All day long these streets are crowded
with the great, the rich, the gay, and the
fair&mdash;and if one looks one may also see here
the poorest, the most abject, the most pitiful,
and most awful of the creatures that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
permits to live. There is more wealth and
splendour than in all the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>,
and more misery than in Dante's <cite>Inferno</cite>.</p>

<p>Such a bustling, jostling, twisting,
wriggling wonder! "An intermixed and
intertangled, ceaselessly changing jingle, too,
of colour; flecks of colour champed, as it
were, like bits in the horses' teeth, frothed
and strewn about, and a surface always of
dark-dressed people winding like the curves
on fast flowing water."</p>

<p>There is everything here, and plenty of it.
As Malaprop Jenkins wrote to her "O Molly
Jones," "All the towns that ever I beheld
in my born days are no more than Welsh
barrows and crumlecks to this wonderful
sitty! Even Bath itself is but a fillitch; in
the naam of God, one would think there's
no end of the streets, but the Land's End.
Then there's such a power of people going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hurry-scurry! Such a racket of coxes!
Such a noise and halibaloo! So many
strange sites to be seen! O gracious! I
have seen the Park, and the Paleass of St.
Gimeses, and the Queen's magisterial pursing,
and the sweet young princes and the hillyfents,
and pybald ass, and all the rest of the Royal
Family."</p>

<p>In two minutes from Piccadilly Circus I
can be at will in France, in Germany, in
Italy, or in Jerusalem. Even at the loneliest
hour of the night I can have company to
walk with; for in Bond Street I meet
Colonel Newcome's stately figure, in Pall
Mall I encounter Peregrine Pickle's new
chariot and horses, by the Thames I find
the skulking figures of Quilp and Rogue
Riderhood, in Southwark I am with Mr.
Pickwick and Sam Weller, in Eastcheap
with immortal Jack Falstaff, sententious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Nym, blustering Pistol, and glow-nosed
Bardolph.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With such companions at my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I float on London's human tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An atom on its billows thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lonely never, nor alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a hundred yards I may jostle an Archbishop
of the Established Church, a Prostitute,
a Poet, a victorious General, the Hero
of the last football match, a Millionaire, a
"wanted" Murderer, a bevy of famous
Actresses, a Socialist Refugee from Spain
or Italy, a tattooed South Sea Islander, a
loose-breeched Man-o'-War's man from
Japan, Armenians, Cretans, Greeks, Jews,
Turks, and Clarionettes from Pudsey.</p>

<p>The mere picturesque externals suffice to
entrance me; but the spell grips like a
vice when I look closer and discriminate
between the types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a commodity of warm slaves has
civilisation gathered here! Such a fascinating
rabble of addle-pated toadies, muddy-souled
bullies of the bagnio, trade-fallen prize-fighters,
aristocratic and other drabs, card
and billiard sharpers, discarded unjust
serving-men, revolted tapsters, touting
tipsters, police-court habitués, cut-purses,
area sneaks, and general slum-scum; pimpled
bookmakers, millionaire sweaters and their
dissipated sons; jerry-builders, members of
Parliament, phosy-jaw and lead poisoners;
African diamond smugglers, peers on the
make, long-nosed company promoters, and
old clo' men; Stock Exchange tricksters,
fraudulent patriotic contractors, earthworms
and graspers; fog-brained and parchment-hearted
crawlers, pigeons, rooks, hawks,
vultures, and carrion crows; the cankers of a
base city and a sordid age; the flunkeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
pimps, and panders of society; the pride
and chivalry of Piccadilly; the carrion,
maggots, and reptiles of an empire upon
whose infamies the sun never wholly succeeds
in hiding its blushing countenance.</p>

<p>There is no fear of my forgetting the
misery and crime underlying London's
splendour. I never invite Mrs. Dangle's
admiration to the flashing lights of Piccadilly
but she sharply reminds me of the pitiful
sights which they illuminate. The ever-fresh
and ever-wonderful magic of the Embankment's
circle as seen by night from Adelphi
Terrace does not efface the remembrance of
Hood's "Bridge of Sighs," nor of Charles
Mackay's "Waterloo Bridge."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In she plunged boldly, no matter how coldly the rough river ran:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the brink of it, picture it, think of it, dissolute Man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lave in it, drink of it, then, if you can!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>I have seen our painted sisters standing
for hire under the flaring gas-lamps. I have
seen ghastly wrecks of humankind slinking
by the blazing shop fronts as if ashamed of
their hungry faces; and others, bloated out
of womanly grace, tottering from gin-palace
doors into side-dens that make one pale and
sick to glance into.</p>

<p>And the interminable battalions of foolish-faced
men in foolish frock-coats and foolish
tall hats, who suck their foolish sticks as
they foolishly amble by!</p>

<p>What tragic and comic contrasts! What
variety!</p>

<p>Faces black and copper faces; yellow faces,
rosy faces, and martyrs' faces ghastly white;
cruel crafty faces, false and leering faces&mdash;faces
cynical, callous, and confident; faces
crushed, abject, bloodless, and woebegone;
satyrs' faces, gross, pampered, impudent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sensual; sneering, arrogant, devilish faces;
and shrinking faces full of prayer and meek
entreaty; vulture faces&mdash;eager, greedy,
ravenous; penguin faces&mdash;fat, smug, and
foolish; faces of whipped curs, fawning
spaniels, and treacherous hounds; wolves'
faces and foxes' faces, and many hapless heads
of puzzled sheep floating helpless down the
current; faces of all tints and forms and
characters; and not a few, thank Heaven!
of faces strong and calm, of faces kind,
modest, and intrepid! of faces blooming,
healthy, pretty, and beautiful!</p>

<p>Gold and grime, purple and shame, squalor
and splendour, contrasts and wonders without
end. And all of it&mdash;all the flotsam and
jetsam of these tumultuous streets&mdash;gallant
hearts, heroes, criminals, millionaires, pretty
girls, and wrecks&mdash;they are all charged,
and overbrimming with interest, for, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Longfellow says, "these are the great themes
of human thought; not green grass, and
flowers, and moonshine."</p>

<p>Yet flowers too can London show.</p>

<p>In the densest quarters of Whitechapel I
have seen grass and trees as green as the
best that can be seen in the choicest districts
of Oldham or Bolton.</p>

<p>As for the West End, no richer, riper
scenes of urban beauty are to be found in
Europe than the stretch of park and garden
spread out between the Horse Guards and
Kensington Palace.</p>

<p>Stand on the steps of the Albert Memorial
and feast your gaze on the woody vistas of
Kensington Gardens; or, from the suspension
bridge of fair St. James's Park, look over the
water to the up-piled, towering white palaces
of Whitehall; or, without exertion at all, lie
down amongst the sheep in the wide green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fields of Hyde Park, and listen to the hum
of the traffic.</p>

<p>Hyde Park's verdurous carpet is shot in
its season with the golden lustre of the
buttercup, dotted with the peeping white of
the timorous daisy, and spangled with the
flaunting, extravagant dandelion. Every tree
is in spring a gorgeous picture, and every
thorn bush a bouquet of fragrant flower.</p>

<p>As for London's outside suburbs, no
English town can show such charming variety
of wood and meadow, of hill and plain.</p>

<p>Smiling uplands and blooming slopes;
bushy lanes, flowered hedges, and crystal
streams; cottages overgrown, according to
the season, with honeysuckle, roses, and
creeping plants of gorgeous varying hues;
smooth green lawns bedecked with flowers;
bracken and woods upon the hills; scampering
rabbits, scattered meditative cattle, placid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sheep, singing birds, swifts and swallows,
rooks high sailing o'er tufted elms; and,
above all, the sweet, blue, cloudless, southern
sky;&mdash;all these may be found on a fine
summer's day within an easy cycle-ride in
any direction from London.</p>

<p>Where shall we find nobler views than
those exposed from Muswell's woody slopes,
or Sydenham's stately terraces; from happy
Hampstead, or haughty Highgate; from rare
Richmond, or, best of all, from glorious
Leith?</p>

<p>Where are sweeter woods than those of
Epping or Hadley? Where such glades as
at Bushey or Windsor? Where so sweet a
garden, or so gracious a stream to water it, as
lies open to the excursionist in the valley
of the Thames between Maidenhead and
beautiful Oxford?</p>

<p>To hear the lark's song gushing forth to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sun on Hampstead's golden heath, to see
the bluebells making soft haze in the Hadley
woods, to watch the children returning
through Highgate to their feculent rookeries
laden with the fair bloom of hawthorn
hedges, to lie on Hyde Park's soft green
velvet, is to bring home the knowledge to
our tarnished hearts that even this city of
fretful stir, weariness, and leaden-eyed despair,
might be sweet and of goodly flavour&mdash;that
even London's cruel face might be made to
beam upon all her children like a maternal
benediction, if they were wise enough to
deserve and demand it!</p>

<p class="noind">The wealth and the poverty! the grandeur
and the wretchedness!</p>

<p>Sir Howard Vincent, a Conservative M.P.,
lately told his Sheffield constituents, after a
round of visits paid to "almost every state
in Europe," that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He had no hesitation in saying that in a walk of a
mile in London, and in the West End too, they saw
more miserable people than he met with in all the
countries enumerated&mdash;more bedraggled, unhappy,
unfortunate out-of-works, seeking alms and bread,
and strong men earning a few pence loitering along
with immoral advertisements on their shoulders. He
granted that there were more people in London with
palatial mansions, luxurious carriages, and high-stepping
horses, but there was much greater poverty
and dire distress among the aged.</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards the luxury, this is true enough.
As regards poverty, London's state is bad&mdash;God
knows!&mdash;infinitely worse than that of
Paris, which I know intimately; but not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bad, according to my more travelled friends,
as that of Russian, Italian, or even Saxon
industrial regions. London's destitution at
its worst is perhaps more brutal, and more
repellent, but not more hopeless than
the more picturesque poverty of sunnier
climes.</p>

<p>Poplar, Stepney, Hoxton, Bethnal Green,
and Whitechapel are as hideous tumours
upon a fair woman's face.</p>

<p>They are vile labyrinths of styes, where
pallid men and women, and skeleton children,&mdash;guileless
little things, fresh from the hands
of God,&mdash;wallow like swine.</p>

<p>Yet, except for vastness, London slums
are not more shameful than the slums Sir
Howard Vincent may find, if he will look
in the town which he has the dishonour of
representing in Parliament.</p>

<p>I saw the slum-scum sweltering in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
close-packed, f&oelig;tid East End courts during
the great water famine last summer (miles of
luxuriously appointed palaces in the gorgeous
West standing the while deserted), but even
then I found them cleaner, fresher, and
sweeter than the slums of Manchester,
Liverpool, Dublin, Dundee, Glasgow,
Birmingham, or Darkest Sheffield.</p>

<p>For over all these London possesses one
precious, inestimable advantage&mdash;the wide
estuary and great air avenue of the Thames,
through which refreshing winds are borne
into the turbid crannies, bringing precious
seeds of health and sweeping out the stagnant
poisons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have beheld the great city in many
aspects, fair and foul. I have seen St. Paul's
pierce with ghostly whiteness through a mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that swathed and wholly hid its lower parts,
the great dome rising like a phantom balloon
from out a phantom city. I have seen a
blue-grey "London particular" transform a
dingy, narrow street into a portal of mystery,
romance, and enchantment. I have loitered
on Waterloo Bridge to gaze on the magic of
the river and listen to the eerie music of
Time's roaring loom. I have heard the
babel of Petticoat Lane on Sunday morning.
I have surveyed the huge wen and contrasted
it with the pleasant Kentish weald from
Leith Hill's summit. And I would not go
back from London to any place that I have
lived in. I like London. I am bitten as I
have seen all bitten that came under its
spell&mdash;bitten as I vowed I never could
be.</p>

<p>London's air is in my lungs and
nostrils, its glamour in my eyes, its roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and moan and music in my ears, its
fever in my blood, its quintessence in my
heart.</p>

<p>I came to scoff and I pray to remain.</p>

<h2>LONDON CHARLIE</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our greatest evil, or our greatest good.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">Moore.</span>
</p>


<p>The celebrated novelist Ouida has made
a general indictment against the "<em>cruel
ugliness and dulness</em>" of the streets of
London.</p>

<p>The greatest city in the world, according
to Mdlle. de la Ramé, has "a curiously
provincial appearance, and in many ways
the aspect of a third-rate town."</p>

<p>Even the aristocratic quarters are "absolutely
and terribly depressing and tedious";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and as for <em>decorative beauty</em>, this is all she
can find of it in London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An ugly cucumber frame like Battersea Park
Hall, gaudily coloured; a waggon drawn by poor,
suffering horses, and laden with shrieking children,
going to Epping Forest; open-air preachers ranting
hideously of hell and the devil; gin-palaces, music-halls,
and the flaring gas-jets on barrows full of
rotting fruit, are all that London provides in the way
of enjoyment or decoration for its multitudes!</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of which, I am free to maintain
that no town of my acquaintance has such
diversity of entertainment.</p>

<p>Paris has the bulge in the trifling, foolish
matter of theatrical plays and players. But
London has more and finer playhouses; as
good opportunities of hearing great music;
and infinitely larger and better-appointed
music-halls.</p>

<p>London has now the finest libraries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
museums, and picture-galleries; and as for
out-door entertainment, no town possesses
such remarkable variety as is offered at the
Imperial Institute, the Crystal and Alexandra
Palaces, Olympia, and Earl's Court. Thereby
hangs a tale.</p>

<p>It must be that the provincial friends who
visit me are not as other men. I hear of
people receiving guests from the country
and taking them out for nice walks to the
National Gallery, South Kensington Museum,
the Tower, and other places of cultured
dissipation provided by the generous rate-payer
to discourage and kill off the cheap-tripper;
but I have no such luck.</p>

<p>To my ardent, blushing commendation of
national eleemosynary entertainments, the
rude provincials who assail my hospitality
reply with a rude provincial wink.</p>

<p>Frequent failure has, I fear, stripped my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
plausibility of its pristine bloom. Time was
when I could boldly recommend Covent
Garden Market at four o'clock in the
morning as a first-rate attraction to the
provincial pilgrim of pleasure, but your
stammering tongue and quailing eye are
plaguy mockers of your useful villainy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangle herself begins to look doubtfully
when, on our periodical little pleasure
trips, I repeat the customary: "Tower! eh?
It will be <em>such</em> a treat!"</p>

<p>Ah me! Confidence was a beautiful thing.
The world grows too cynical. Earl's Court
is the thin end of the wedge by which the
hydra-headed serpent of unbelief is bred to
fly roughshod over the thin ice of irresolute
dissimulation, to nip the mask of pretence
in the bud, and with its cold, uncharitable
eye to suck the very life-blood of that confidence
which is the corner-stone and sheet-anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of friendly trust 'twixt man and
man.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, my praise of County
Council Parks and County Council Bands, of
Tower history and Kensington culture, is as
ineffectual as a Swedish match in a gale.</p>

<p>My visitors, as with one accord, reply,
"That is neither here nor there. We are
going to Earl's Court."</p>

<p>Thus, Captandem had come to town, and
said "he wanted to see things."</p>

<p>I tempted him with the usual programme.</p>

<p>"I am told," I insinuated, "that the
Ethnographical Section of the British
Museum 'silently but surely teaches many
beautiful lessons.'"</p>

<p>"I daresay," he sneered.</p>

<p>"The educational facilities furnished by
South Kensington Museum"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Educational fiddlesticks," interrupted he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Tower," I went on, "is improving
to the mind."</p>

<p>"I have had some."</p>

<p>"The National Gallery"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be hanged!" he snorted. "Do you
take me for an Archæological Conference?
or a British Association picnic?"</p>

<p>"Well," I began, in my most winning
Board-meeting manner, "if you don't like
my suggestions, you can go to"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Earl's Court," he opportunely snapped.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He then explained that he had been reading
in <cite>The Savoy</cite>, a poem by Sarojini
Chattopâdhyây on "Eastern Dancers," commencing
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate spirits aflaming with fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exquisite, subtle, and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical slumber-soft feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and lingering languish in radiant choir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their jewel-bright arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant thro' the summer-swift hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, their passionate spirits aflaming with fire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When I had finished reading this too-too
all but morsel of exquisiteness, the Boy said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he'd be punctured if he could exactly catch
the hang of the thing (the Philistine!), but
he thought he would like some of those (the
heathen!), and having seen an announcement
that a troupe of Eastern Dancers were then
appearing at Earl's Court, he had determined
to let his passionate, with fire-aflaming spirit
"drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth
heavens."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the way to Earl's Court, I filled up the
Boy with such general information about
Nautch Girls, as I had gathered in my
studies.</p>

<p>I informed him that nothing could exceed
the transcendent beauty, both in form and
lineament, of these admirable creatures; that
their dancing was the most elegant and gently
graceful ever seen, for that it comprised no
prodigious springs, no vehement pirouettes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
no painful tension of the muscles, or extravagant
contortions of the limbs; no violent
sawing of the arms; no unnatural curving of
the limbs, no bringing of the legs at right
angles with the trunk; no violent hops or
jerks, or dizzy jumps.</p>

<p>The Nautch Girl's arms, I assured him,
move in unison with her tiny, naked feet,
which fall on earth as mute as snow. She
occasionally turns quickly round, expanding
the loose folds of her thin petticoat, when
the heavy silk border with which it is trimmed
opens into a circle round her, showing for an
instant the beautiful outline of her form,
draped with the most becoming and judicious
taste.</p>

<p>She wears, I continued, scarlet or purple
celestial pants, and veils of beautiful gauze
with tassels of silver and gold. The graceful
management of the veil by archly peeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
under it, then radiantly beaming over it, was
in itself enough, I assured him, to make one's
eyes celestially pant, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dis way for Indu juggler, Indu tumbler,
Nautch Dance," at this moment cried a shrill
voice at my side; and I perceived that we
were actually standing outside the Temple
where the passionate spirits in celestial pants
drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth
heavens!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The performance had begun. An able-bodied,
well-footed Christy Minstrel was
doing a sort of shuffling walk-round, droning
out the while a monotonous wail in a voice
that might have been more profitably
employed to kill cats.</p>

<p>"Lor'," the Boy complained, "will that
suffering nigger last long? Couldn't they
get him to reserve his funeral service for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
own graveyard? Ask them how soon they
mean to trot out the exquisite, subtle
Tremulous Dawns,&mdash;the swaying and swinging
Sandalwood Slumber-soft Flutter in
celestial pants,&mdash;the wantonly winding Lingering
Languishers?"</p>

<p>I approached one of the artistes&mdash;a lean
and dejected Fakir, picturesquely attired in
a suit of patched atmosphere.</p>

<p>"That's very nice," I said conciliatorily,
"very nice indeed, in its way. But we don't
much care for Wagner's music, nor Christy
Minstrels. We would prefer to take a
walk until your cornerman is through:
at what time will the Nautch Girls
appear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the heathen Hindu replied,
with a knowing leer, "Nautch Girl ver' good,
ver' good; Lonndonn Charlee, he likee
Nautch Girl, ver' good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "What time do they kick
off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, ver' good, ver' good, Nautch
Girl," the mysterious Oriental replied; "she
Nautch Girl bimeby done now; me go do
conjur, ver' good, ver' good."</p>

<p>"Nautch Girl nearly done?" I cried.
"Why, where <em>is</em> the Nautch Girl!"</p>

<p>"That Nautch Girl is dance now, ver' good,
ver' good. Lonndonn Charlee, he likee
Nautch Girl, ver' good."</p>

<p>At last the horrible truth dawned on me!</p>

<p>The person we had taken for a Christy
Minstrel was the wantonly winding, lingeringly
languishing Nautch Girl!!!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After that we visited other "side shows,"
and saw more dejected Hindoos perform
marvellous feats of jugglery and conjuring,
with the aid of trained mongooses, monkeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and goats. Also an extraordinary game of
football by Burmese players, who catch a
glass ball on their necks and ankles as
dexterously as Ranjitsinhji catches a cricket
ball with his hands. Also we saw the
acrobats who balance themselves on a bamboo
pole by gripping it with their stomachs&mdash;a
trick which I have since practised with
but incomplete success.</p>

<p>We also saw the juggling of an Indian
humorist with two attendants, who, if they
did not realise all the wonders we have read
about Indian conjurers, did at least perform
miracles with the English language and the
linked sweetness of music too long drawn
out.</p>

<p>The attendants sat on the ground and beat
monotonous drums, what time the conjurer
walked to and fro and played a peculiarly
baneful type of Indian bagpipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ram, ram, ram, ram, kurte heren ugh!"
sang the conjurer.</p>

<p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh! ugh!" sang the
chorus, rolling their eyes and swaying their
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Baen, deina, juldee, chup, chup!" droned
the conjurer.</p>

<p>"Chup, chup, chup, chup," wailed the
chorus.</p>

<p>"Hum mugurer hue! hum padre hue!
hum booker se mur jata hue!" cried the
conjurer.</p>

<p>"Hue! hue! hue! hue!" replied the
chorus.</p>

<p>Then, "one, two, three, four, five, nine,
sumting, fifteen, twenty," cried the conjurer,
fumbling with his conjuring gear; "see dere,
dere de egg; Lonndonn chicken egg, chicken
egg, chicken egg."</p>

<p>"Chicken egg, chicken egg," repeated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
chorus in triumphant tones; and banged the
mournful drums.</p>

<p>By weird Hindu enchantment, they beguiled
Captandem to the platform to assist,
and having got him there, proceeded to make
him wish he wasn't.</p>

<p>"Lonndonn Charlee," cried the conjurer,
triumphantly introducing him; "Lonndonn
Charlee, Lonndonn Charlee, say now uchmeechulouchuadmee,"
and grinned like a
heathen.</p>

<p>"Uchmeechulouchuadmee," wailed the
chorus.</p>

<p>"Uchmee&mdash;uchmee&mdash;oh! I can't say it,"
cried poor London Charlie, and the chorus,
showing all its flashing teeth, victoriously
droned a mocking "Bu-u-uh!" which
obviously completed London Charlie's discomfiture
and distress.</p>

<p>"Lennee me Lonndonn sixpence, Lonndonn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Charlee," cried the conjurer; and the youthful
Captandem, after much inward searching,
produced the coin demanded.</p>

<p>The conjurer took it in his hand, placed
it under a flower-pot, and said: "Ulla ulla
juldeechupalee"; and the chorus shouted,
"Chupalee."</p>

<p>Then followed two or three more experiments
and practical jokes on London
Charlie's confiding innocence, till at last
London Charlie, unwilling to bear any more
ridicule, leaped from the platform and
desperately fled the scene&mdash;looking as unlike
the cocksure London Charlie that went up, as
doth the tin-kettled feline maniac which has
fallen amongst felonious boys, to the smug and
purring pet of the ancient spinster's fireside.</p>

<p>Poor little London Charlie.</p>

<p>It was not till long afterwards that he
remembered his sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Captandem!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Still he enjoyed himself, and, if the truth
must be told, there are moments when even
I am less amused by the mummies and
fossils of the museums than by the lights,
the fountains, the colour, and the movement
of Earl's Court.</p>

<p>I wonder why it never occurs to the
philanthropists and municipalities which
provide picture-galleries, libraries, and other
elevating institutions for the people, to try
the effect upon Whitechapel or Ancoats of
a genuine place of <em>amusement</em>.</p>

<p>The class from which our philanthropists
chiefly spring, regard with suspicion nearly
everything in which the common people
find spontaneous pleasure; and, instead of
helping the development and improvement
of such natural sources of delight, they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
aim to "elevate" the masses by mortifying
their flesh and wearying their souls.</p>

<p>To "elevate" them, the philanthropists
close their eyes to all that delights the
common people, and thrust upon them,
willy-nilly, something which interests them
not at all, something which they cannot
understand, something which nips and
chills and infinitely bores them.</p>

<p>The philanthropists, when they give of
their benefactions to the people, cannot, or
will not, see that to teach a mouse to fly, it
is needful for the teacher to begin by stepping
down to the earth. They insist, as a
condition of their generosity, that the
people shall be thereby flabbergasticated,
petriflummoxed, and aggrawetblankalysed
with everlasting doldrums.</p>

<p>Show me, anywhere, 'twixt Widnes and
Heaven&mdash;which is as wide a stretch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
imagination may compass&mdash;any public institution
founded by private munificence for
the people's delectation, to which the people
flock with cheerful alacrity, or wherein the
people bear themselves with anything like
holiday jauntiness.</p>

<p>The public museums and picture-galleries
are very fine institutions, but how much do
they affect or brighten the lives of the mass?
How do they touch the common people?
How many of the Slum-scum come? and
how often? Do they enjoy the painted and
sculptured masterpieces presented to their
admiration? Is it possible that, without
guidance or explanation, they can understand
the beauty of these, their treasures?</p>

<p>Behold the stragglers that come&mdash;how
puzzled, awestruck, furtive, and ill-at-ease
they are! There is fear of the Superior
Person in their face, and of the policeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in their tread. They stare at the frames,
at the skylights, at the polished floors, at
the attendants, and at the modified Minervas
in No. 9 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pince-nez</i> who are the most regular
frequenters of such places; but they scarcely
see the pictures. They walk on their toes
to prevent noise, cough apologetically,
shrivel under the withering glances of the
modified Minervas, and look ostentatiously
unhappy.</p>

<p>The modified Minervas walk round with
the air of exclusive proprietorship. They
are at home. They pervade the place.
The young ones stare with mild amazement
or languid curiosity at the unaccustomed,
aberrant hewer of wood or drawer of water,
as if speculating as to which of the more
remote planets he sprang from; the elder
ones glare at him through their eyeglasses
with such scathing disdain as to confirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him in his opinion that his entrance there
was an unpardonable liberty.</p>

<p>The public museums and picture-galleries
are made, not for the common people of
the seething slums, but for the modified
Minervas of the genteel suburbs. These
are the legatees of the public philanthropists.
That which is given for the "elevation of
the masses" tends in practice to elevate
nothing except the already tilted tips of
their particularly cultured noses. The
benevolent Cr&oelig;sus produces no happiness
by his benefaction, except that which these
ladies derive from the admiring contemplation
of their refined superiority.</p>

<p>What the common people want is the
glitter of spectacle, the intoxication of
beauty and grace, of music and dance;
the sensation of light and brightness and
stirring movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The wisest thing to do with appetites so
old-established and deep-rooted is, not to
suppress, but to guide them.</p>

<p>Obstruct them, and they will run into dark
and dirty channels out of sight; recognise
and cultivate them in the clear light of day,
and they may produce in every town even
better sources of amusement than Earl's
Court.</p>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">Charles Mackay.</span>
</p>


<p>Once upon a time, as the charmed books
tell, there was a mountain covered with
stones, of which each particular flint or
pebble had been, "upon a time," a live and
sentient man or woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The stones lay, with no attribute of life
except a power to appeal in such wise to
passers-by as to compel them to remain.
But there came, one happy day, a beauteous
maiden with a pitcher full of the Water of
Life, and she, sprinkling the precious fluid
over the stones, transformed them again into
animated creatures of flesh and blood&mdash;"a
great company of youths and maidens who
followed her down the mountain."</p>

<p>As I take my walks in London-town, I
think of that story and long for a pitcher of
the magic Water of Life.</p>

<p>For if imagination may trace the noble
dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a
bung-hole, and if, as biologists tell us, the
whole of our mortal tissue is unceasingly
being shed and renewed, every brick and
stone in London pavement, church, inn, and
dwelling-house must have in it some part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
human greatness; for the flower of Britain's
brain and valour, the heroes of her most
glorious service and achievement&mdash;poets,
philosophers, prelates, princes, statesmen,
soldiers, scientists, explorers&mdash;the greatest
of those who have "toiled and studied for
mankind," have lived in London.</p>

<p>Milton used to thank God that he had
been born in London. Shakespeare acted
in Blackfriars and near London Bridge; his
wit flashed nightly at the Mermaid; in the
shadow of Whitehall, he broke his heart for
Mary Fitton; and here he wove the magic of
his plays.</p>

<p>That is the consideration which makes
London's enchantment so irresistible. Here is
the actual, visible scene of the most momentous
deeds of our history, of the most memorable
episodes in our country's fiction, and of the
workaday, toiling, rejoicing, and sorrowing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the greatest of our English brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>At Charing Cross the statue of Charles I.
on his Rabelais horse faces the site of the
scaffold "in the open street," on to which
the king stepped one morning through a
window of his palace of Whitehall. Pepys
saw General Harrison hanged, drawn, and
quartered at Charing Cross, he (Harrison)
"looking as cheerful as any man could in
that condition." And he gravely adds that
Sir Harry Vane, about to be beheaded on
Tower Hill, urgently requested the executioner
to take off his head so as not to hurt a
pimple on his neck.</p>

<p>Trooper Lockyer, a brave young soldier of
seven years' service, though only twenty-three
years old, having helped to seize General
Cromwell's colours at the Bull in Bishopsgate,
was shot in Paul's Churchyard by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a><br /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
grim Oliver's orders. His crime was that
he was a Leveller or early Socialist, "with hot
notions as to human freedom, and the rate
at which millenniums are obtainable. He
falls shot in Paul's Churchyard on Friday,
amid the tears of men and women," says
Carlyle, Paul's Cathedral being then a horse-guard,
with horses stamping in the canons'
stalls, and its leaden roof melted into bullets.
On the following Monday the corpse having
been "watched and wept over" meantime
"in the eastern regions of the City," brave
Lockyer was buried "at the new churchyard
in Westminster":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The corpse was adorned with bundles of Rosemary,
one half stained with blood. . . . Some thousands
followed in rank and file: all had sea-green and black
ribbon tied on their hats and to their breasts; and
the women brought up the rear.</p></blockquote>

<p>How actual and visible and present they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
are, as one stands on the spots where these
great events were transacted! And such
histories has nearly every street and every
ancient building. London is not paved with
gold. It is paved with the glory of England's
mighty dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The name is Legion of the eminences
whose last cumbrous clog of clay is buried
here.</p>

<p>In Westminster's venerable and beautiful
Abbey, where I saw Gladstone buried last
June, I can look on the bury-hole of Edward
the Confessor, King of our remote Anglo-Saxon
ancestors, and one of the prime
founders of English liberties; I see the tomb
of that butcher Edward who subdued Wales
and overthrew Scotland's Wallace; here, too,
is the grave of the third Edward, who, by his
raiding and stealing, laid the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
England's glorious commerce. Here, under
his Agincourt helmet, lies the valiant dust
of Falstaff's Prince Hal, and of three other
Royal Henrys. Bloody Mary rests from her
fiery rage; Mary Queen of Scots is united
in death to her terrible foe, Elizabeth of
England; and two Stuart Kings repose uncomplainingly
by the side of William of
Orange.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here mighty troublers of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who swam to sov'reign rule through seas of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oppressive, sturdy, man-destroying villains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ravag'd kingdoms, and laid empires waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a cruel wantonness of power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinn'd states of half their people, and gave up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To want the rest; now, like a storm that's spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie hushed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From these crumbled majesties I turn
with reverence to aisles hallowed by the
mould of Darwin, Dickens, Thackeray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Browning, Macaulay, Livingstone, Garrick,
and Handel.</p>

<p>Beneath St. Paul's great dome my
gratitude can tender homage to the names
of Titanic Turner, Reynolds, Landseer,
Napier, Cornwallis, Wellington, and Nelson.</p>

<p>Think what a procession if all these could
be sprinkled with the Water of Life! If to
each fragment of noble dust in this huge,
unshapely, and overgrown wilderness of
masonry, one could call back the soul
that sometime quickened it, what a great
city, in Walt Whitman's sense, would
London be!</p>

<p>Every town cherishes the sacred memory
of its own particular great man, but London
bears in its bosom intimate and familiar
tokens of them all. The city and its
neighbourhood for miles round are marked
with historic and literary associations. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
place is all composed of great men's fame
and chapters of world-history. London Clay
is made of London's Pride, and London
Pride grows in the London Clay.</p>

<p>Not a quarter, not a suburb is free of
hallowed associations.</p>

<p>Within half an hour's stroll from my home
at Highgate I can visit the pleasaunce of
which Andrew Marvell wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have a garden of my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so with roses overgrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lilies, that you would it guess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a little wilderness.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">I cross the threshold of the adjoining house,
and stand within the actual domicile of staid
Andrew's improper neighbour, Mistress Nell
Gwynne. It was from a window of this
house she threatened to drop her baby,
unless her Merry Monarch would there and
then confer name and title on him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thus came England into the honour and
glory of a ducal race of St. Albans.</p>

<p>When Nell Gwynne looked up from that
signally successful jest, she may have seen,
across the street, the two houses wherein,
a few years before, had dwelt the stern
Protector of the Commonwealth and the
husband of his daughter, Ireton. I wonder
what she thought of old Noll!</p>

<p>The houses stand there yet, substantial,
square, their red brick "mellowed but not
impaired by time."</p>

<p>The "restored" Charles had had the
corpses of over a hundred Puritans,
including Admiral Blake's, and that of
Cromwell's old mother, dug up from their
graves and flung in a heap in St.
Margaret's Churchyard; he had hung in
chains on Tyburn gallows the disinterred
clay of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I wonder he was not prompted to pull down
these dwellings of his father's "murderers."
He must have seen them often. Their
windows overlooked the garden of his
light-o'-love.</p>

<p>Did <em>she</em> intercede to have them preserved?
As I linger there, I like to think so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Still within a half-mile circle of my home,
on the same Highgate Hill whereon stand
the houses of Nell Gwynne and Ireton, I
can show my children the "werry, indentical"
milestone from which&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita legenda
scripta</i>&mdash;Dick Whittington was recalled by
the sound of Bow Bells.</p>

<p>At the top of Highgate Hill, and on the
slope of another hill where a man (since
dead in the workhouse) saved Queen
Victoria's life, stands the house where
Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived. Here, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it is said, in a little inn near by, he
entertained such company as Shelley, Keats,
Byron, Leigh Hunt, and&mdash;surely not in the
little inn?&mdash;Carlyle.</p>

<p>Coleridge lies buried in the churchyard
hard by, and in Highgate Cemetery I find
the graves of George Eliot, Michael Faraday,
Charles Dickens' daughter Dora, Tom Sayers
the prize-fighter, and Lillywhite the cricketer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Harry Lowerison has a way of teaching
children by taking them to see the streets
and monuments of London; and I can think
of no more interesting or promising mode of
instruction.</p>

<p>For in these scenes English history is
indelibly and picturesquely written, back to
the date of our earliest records.</p>

<p>I stood one day in Cannon Street, when a
passing omnibus-horse chanced to slip. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
vehicle swerved across the asphalt, and, to
complete the catastrophe, the horse fell.</p>

<p>Then, hey, presto! in the twinkling of
an eye, the street was blocked with a compact
mass of "blue carts and yellow omnibuses,
varnished carriages and brown vans, green
omnibuses and brown cabs, pale loads of
yellow straw, rusty red iron clanking on
paintless carts, high white wool packs, grey
horses, bay horses, black teams; sunlight
sparkling on the brass harness, gleaming
from the carriage panels; jingle, jingle,
jingle."</p>

<p>A bustling, shuffling, pushing, wriggling,
twisting wonder! One moment's damming
of the stream had caused such a gathering as
Imperial Cæsar never dreamt of.</p>

<p>I was pushed back against the wall, and
then observed that I stood by the London
Stone&mdash;a stone which "'midst the tangling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
horrors of the wood" by Thames side, may
have been drenched with the human gore
of druidical sacrifices. Captives bound in
wicker rods may have burned upon its
venerable surface to glut the fury of savage
gods.</p>

<p>That stone stood here when Constantine
built the London Wall around the "citty."</p>

<p>It was here when, upon an island formed
by a river which crept sullenly through "a
fearful and terrible plain," which none might
approach after nightfall without grievous
danger, King Sebert of the East Saxons
built to the glory of St. Peter the Apostle
that church which is known to our generation
as Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The London Stone stood when Sebert built
a church on the ruins of Diana's Temple,
where now stands St. Paul's Cathedral.
London was built before Rome, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the fall of the Assyrian monarchs, over a
thousand years before the birth of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Who knows? Where I stood, old Chaucer
may have stood to see his Canterbury
Pilgrims pass. Falstaff, reeling home from
Dame Quickly's Tavern with his load of sherris-sack,
may have sat here to ponder on his
honour. Shakespeare may have leaned on
the old milestone as he watched the Virgin
Queen's pageant to Tilbury Fort in Armada
times. Through James Ball's and Jack
Cade's uprising, through the Wars of the
Roses, the Fire of London, the Plague, the
Stuart upheaval, and Cromwell's stirring times&mdash;through
all these the London Stone stood,
"fixed in the ground very deep," says
Stowe, "that if carts do runne against it
through negligence the wheels be broken,
and the stone itself unshaken." And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it links the bustle and roar of modern
London with the strife out of which London
grew, and keeps our conceits reminded of
the forefathers who lived and fought in
Britain here to make the way more smooth
for us.</p>

<p>Ere cabs or omnibuses were; ere telephones,
telegraphs, or railways; ere Magna
Charta; before William the Conqueror
brought our ancient nobility's ancestors over
from Normandy&mdash;London knew this stone.</p>

<p>It has endured longer than any king, it
has survived generations and dynasties of
monarchs. "Walls have ears," they say,
and Shakespeare "finds tongues in trees,
books in running brooks, and sermons in
stones."</p>

<p>What a tale would he tell that could find
the tongue of the London Stone!</p>

<p>Think of all the men and women who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
have passed it, seen it with their eyes, felt
it with their hands; the millions of simple,
faithful, anonymous people who have cheerfully
slaved, and bled, and died, to help&mdash;as
each according to his lights conceived&mdash;the
honour, safety, and well-being of his
country.</p>

<p>We have paid homage to the celebrated
dead: what about those that have done their
duty and have received neither fame nor
monument? Their blood, too, cries out to
me from the paving-stones of London.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas for men! that they should be so blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laud as gods the scourges of their kind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call each man glorious who has led a host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him most glorious who has murdered most!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that men should lavish upon these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most obsequious homage of their knees&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That those who labour in the arts of peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the nations prosper and increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should fill a nameless and unhonoured grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their worth forgotten by the crowd they save&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But that the Leaders who despoil the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill it with tears, and quench its children's mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should with their statues block the public way,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But thanks to the efforts of Mr. G. F.
Watts, R.A., and Mr. Walter Crane, London
is at last in a fair way to pay homage also
to these unsung and unhonoured heroes of
lowly life.</p>

<p>During the Jubilee of 1887 Mr. Watts
urged that cloisters or galleries should be
erected throughout the country and frescoes
painted therein, to record the shining deeds
of the Democracy's great men and great
women. Such a Campo Santo is now being
prepared in the new Postmen's Park in
Aldersgate Street, and one of the first frescoes
to be painted there by Mr. Crane will commemorate
the valiant act of one Alice Ayres,
a young nurse-girl who rescued her three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
young charges from a burning house, she
herself perishing in the flames.</p>

<p>When I go to Paris, my favourite pilgrimage
is to the Mur des Fédérés in the Père-la-Chaise
Cemetery, where the last of the
Communists were mowed down by the
mitrailleuse.</p>

<p>My sincerest worship of the dead in
London will be tendered in the Campo
Santo of the Postmen's Park, and I hope
one day to pay my homage there to the
memorial of Trooper Lockyer.</p>

<p>"Much time," says Andrews in his
history of the sixteenth century, "was spent
by the citizens of London at their numerous
taverns."</p>

<p>The tavern was the lounging-place, not
only of the idle and dissolute, but of the
industrious also. It was the Club, the
Forum, sometimes too the Theatre.</p>

<p>The wives and daughters of tradesmen
collected here to gossip, and, strange as it
now seems to us they came here, too, to
picnic. An old song of the period describes
a feast of this sort, and tells how each woman
carried with her some goose, or pork, the
wing of a capon, or a pigeon pie. Arrived at
the tavern, they ordered the best wine. They
praised the liquor, and, under its inspiriting
influence, discussed their husbands,
with whom they were naturally dissatisfied;
and then went home by different streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
perfidiously assuring their lawful masters
that they had been to church.</p>

<p>This evidence is useful and seemly to be
here set down, as indicating the true origin of
habits for which much undeserved censure
has been in these later days inflicted upon
mere imitators.</p>

<p>The men, whose chiefest fault has ever
been their too great readiness to follow the
women, fell insensibly into the habit, and
have been there ever since.</p>

<p>And what a glorious time they have had
of it! To recall only Fuller's description of
the "wit combates" between Shakespeare's
"quickness of wit and invention" against
Ben Jonson's "far higher learning," and
"solid, but slow performances," at the
historic Mermaid; and Beaumont's rapturous
praise in his epistle to Jonson
of the banquet of wit and admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a><br /><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
conversation which they had enjoyed at the
same place!</p>

<p>Oh to have been at the Mermaid on the
night when Jonson had been burnt out at
the Bankside Globe! or on the night of
Shakespeare's first performance before Elizabeth&mdash;when
he had first, perhaps, set eyes on
Mary Fitton!</p>

<p>All the wits of that age of giants were
wont to assemble, after the theatre, at the
Mermaid, the Devil, and the Boar. Exuberant
Fletcher and graver Beaumont would
"wentle" in from their lodging on Bankside,
wearing each other's clothes, and wrangling
perhaps about their plots&mdash;a habit which on
one occasion caused them to be arrested,
a fussy listener having heard them disputing
in a tavern as to whether they
should or should not assassinate the king.
Poor, drunken, profligate Greene, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
debauched companions, Marlowe and George
Peele,&mdash;all of whom ended their riotous
courses with painful and shameful deaths,&mdash;are
sure to have lurched in on many a
razzling night. Regular visitors, too, were
"Crispinus" Dekker, and his friend Wilson
the actor, whom Beaumont mentions as a
boon-companion over the Mermaid wine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">From Whitehall, with "their port so proud,
their buskin, and their plume," would swagger
in Raleigh, Surrey, Spenser, and others
of the wits from Elizabeth's ruffling Court.
Drummond of Hawthornden came here at
least once on a visit to Ben Jonson; but
this must have been after Shakespeare had
deserted the festive board for the crested
pomp of a gentlemanly life at Stratford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
"coming up every term to take tobacco
and see new motions."</p>

<p>Sombre John Webster would be here
sometimes, sometimes Massinger, Thomas
Middleton, Lilly, Thomas Heywood, William
Rowley, Day, Wilkins, Ford, Camden, Ned
Drayton, Fulke Greville, Harrington, Edmund
Waller, Martin, Morley, Selden, the future
Bishop of Winchester, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et cetera, et cetera,

<p>What a galaxy! what a feast!</p>

<p>It is well for your peace of mind, my good
wife, that the Mermaid and its company
have vanished into the dark immensity.
How long would I wait, and cheerfully, for
so much as a peep through the window at
that glorious company!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dryden claims that the Mermaid did not
receive such pleasant and such witty fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in the reigns of Bess and James as did the
Royal Oak, the Mitre, and the Roebuck
after the Restoration; but to me the haunts
of Wycherley, Otway, Villiers of Buckingham,
Wilmot of Rochester, and the periwigged
bucks and bloods and maccaronies in velvets
and lace of Charles the Second's dissolute
Court, are, as compared with the Falstaffian
Taverns of the Shakespeareans, but dull and
dry dens.</p>

<p>So, if you will, of your grace, excuse the
pun and the hasty skip, we will give these
pretty gentlemen a miss, and jump at once
into a fresh chapter and an account of a
curious experience that once upon a time
came in a tavern to me.</p>

<p>At last I was alone. The landlord, douce
man, could stand no more; his conversation
had been large and ample up to midnight,
and had indeed left a fair remainder to
spread a feast for solitude; but for the last
two hours he had done nothing but alternately
yawn and doze.</p>

<p>Now, thank goodness, he had gone, and
I could read in peace.</p>

<p>Angels and ministers of grace defend us&mdash;Bacon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<cite>Essays</cite> and Donnelly's <cite>Cryptogram</cite>!&mdash;in
the parlour of a shabby
old inn! Was mine host, then, of a literary
turn? Ay, I had noted his gushing praise of
Burns and Walter Scott; and, by the way,
what was it he said about Shakespeare's
visit to Edinburgh? He had shown me a
letter in a book: I had been too intensely
bored by his trowelled praise of Scottish lochs,
Scottish mountains, haggis, parritch, usquebaugh,
and Scottish poetry, to pay much
heed&mdash;but yes, this must be it. Drummond's
<cite>Sonnets</cite>, and here evidently was the
letter, signed by Ben Jonson, indorsed "to
my very good friend, the lairde of Hawthornden":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Master vill,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quhen we were drinking at my Lordis

<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson.</span>
</p>

<p>From my lodging in the canongait,</p>

<p>Mrch the twelft, 1619.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here also had Shakespeare anticipated
me? Had he been to Edinburgh too?</p>

<p>I might have known: but lo! I grow so
used to our resemblances, I almost cease to
notice them.</p>

<p>Donnelly too! I had never seen his book
before&mdash;though I have taken keen interest
in the subject ever since Delia Bacon arose
in&mdash;well, the land where they do raise Bacon&mdash;and
found Shakespeare out.</p>

<p>Could it indeed be true that Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was an ignorant impostor, whose business
it was to hold respectable gentlemen's horses
at the stage-door of the theatre, instead of
which he wickedly suborned the Lord High
Chancellor of England to write his plays for
him, and the same with intent to deceive?</p>

<p>To make sure, I read a few pages of
Donnelly.</p>

<p>Even that failed to convince me: the
more I read, the more I didn't know.</p>

<p>I saw Shakespeare's <cite>Works</cite> on the bookshelf,
and reached the volume down. It
opened at the <cite>Sonnets</cite>.</p>

<p>Ah! what exquisite music! But&mdash;what
was this?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Your</em> name, from hence, immortal life shall have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though <em>I</em>, once gone, to all the world must die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again in Sonnet XXXVIII.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If my slight muse do please these curious days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pain be <em>mine</em>, but <em>thine</em> shall be the praise.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>And in the next:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what is't but mine own when I praise <em>thee</em>?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Curious, surely. What could these lines
mean?</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>My life hath in this line some interest.</i>
</p>

<p>What if the true cryptogram were concealed
in this strangely emphasised and deeply noted
line? What if it were left to me to solve the
mystery?</p>

<p>By Jove! here <em>was</em> a discovery! Writing
"interest" "interrest," as it would be written
in the manuscript, the letters in the line spell
the words</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Mistress Mary Fitton</span>";
</p>

<p class="noind">and Mistress Mary Fitton, as everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
knows, is the Dark Lady of the <cite>Sonnets</cite>,
the lady who had "her Will, and Will to
boot, and Will in overplus"; to wit, Will
Shakespeare; her young lover, William
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke; and the respectable
elderly lover whom she was plighted to
marry at his wife's death&mdash;Sir William
Knollys, Comptroller of the Household to
Queen Elizabeth!</p>

<p>Mary Fitton's identity with the lady of
the Sonnets has been established beyond
question by Lady Newdegate's publication
of <cite>Passages in the Lives of Anne and Mary
Fitton</cite>. The perfect anagram which I had
accidentally discovered in the most pointedly
accentuated line in the whole of the <cite>Sonnets</cite>,
was therefore something more than curious.</p>

<p>I next took the entire passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But be contented: when that fell arrest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without all bail shall carry me away,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>My life hath in this line some interest,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which for memorial still with me shall stay.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After an hour's wrestling I had extracted
from the letters forming these four lines,
these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Learn ye that have a little wit y<sup>t</sup> <span class="smcap">Francis
Bacon these lines to Mistress Mary Fitton,
Elizabeth's maid of honour</span> at Whitehalle, hath
writt."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the anagram was imperfect. Several
letters included in the words of the sonnet,
remained unused in my anagram.</p>

<p>It was maddening to arrive so near
success, to touch it as it were with one's,
finger tips, yet fail for a few foolish trifling
alphabetic signs.</p>

<p>Desperately, frantically, I struggled to
complete and perfect the anagram; but the
more I juggled with the letters, the more
bewildered, mazed, and helpless I became.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
My blood was a-fire, my head a horrible
ache, my brain a whirling tornado of dancing
vowels and consonants.</p>

<p>The excitement, if still fed and unsatisfied,
must lead, I felt, to brain fever or madness.</p>

<p>I tore myself from the intoxicating pursuit,
and fell, restless, sleepless, yet painfully
weary, upon the couch beneath the window.</p>

<p>It was a wild winter's night, and the view
outside was full of "fowle horror and eke
hellish dreriment." The cordon of turrets
girding the city bulged eerily through the
heavy gloom like limbs of a skeleton starkly
protruding through a lampblack shroud. A
beam of lurid moonlight uncannily lit up
a distant stretch of bluff, stern crags, and
nearer spectral foreground of towers, gables,
and bartisans.</p>

<p>Deep down in the hollow, dismal and
desolate, under a sky of raven's feathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
glowered murder-stained Holyrood, congenial
to the night. The solitary glimmer
on the thunder and battle-scarred Castle
Rock, looked like a match held up to show
the darkness.</p>

<p>The melancholy patter of the rain, and
the discordant creaking and rattling of an
iron shutter and rusty hinge, made music
harmonious to the scene.</p>

<p>The air of the musty room added to the
contagious heaviness. In vain I stretched
the astral sceptre of the soul upon the incorporeal
pavement of conjecture. Nothing
came of it, except that I slipped off the
couch. I was too restless to think. Even
the dog, on the rug at my feet, uneasily
twitched and growled in his sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I became conscious of a creepy
chill; my head, by some impulse foreign to
my volition, was raised from its meditative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
pose; and in the spluttering, dying beam of
the lamp's light, I beheld an Apparition.</p>

<p>A grim and grisly goblin, of unwholesome
oatcake hue, fluttered (no other word describes
the wild and fitful unreliability of his
movements) before my startled gaze; his
eyes, like glassy beads, shone horridly.</p>

<p>My dog raised his head, and looked over
his shoulder. When his gaze fell on the
Apparition he bounded to his feet, his limbs
shaking like jelly, his eyes projecting like
shining stars, and his hair standing up round
his neck like a frill.</p>

<p>He tried to growl, but the sound, shaken
and softened by terror, issued to the night
in lamb-like bleats. Yet more appalled by
his vocal failure, he shrank, still feebly bleating,
backwards under the sofa.</p>

<p>For my part, I believe I may say I was not
afraid, but intensely excited. I felt that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was about to be revealed to me; this
was the reason why my hand trembled so as
to knock Shakespeare, Bacon, and Donnelly
in one commingled heap of fallen glory to
the floor.</p>

<p>I was curious, fascinated, and highly
wrought.</p>

<p>The wild and fitful little shape bewilderingly
wriggled and flickered in the light, and
his ghast and fixed eye was painful to endure.
Yet I felt that we two had not met without
reason. Instinct told me we should do business.</p>

<p>He was the jerkiest and perkiest little
figure I had ever clapped eyes on. He bore
his head with confident, nay impudent, erectness;
his arms waved like a windmill's; and
his shapeless little legs straddled all over the
place in a succession of purposeless leaps and
flings and prancings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>So quick and fidgety were his movements
that it was not easy to catch the details of his
dress; but I saw that his tartan was a spider's
web, to whose check the slimy snail had imparted
a variety of hue unknown to Macgregor
or Macpherson; his bonnet was a flowering
thistle; his philabeg was made of the beards
of oat-florets; his buckle was a salmon's
scale; and a blade of finest rye dangled
proudly by his side.</p>

<p>"Ye'll know me the noo if ye'll speir lang
enoo," he squealed ironically when I had
stared for some moments. "Gape and glower
till your lugs crack, but ye canna' alter the
fact that a' great men are Scots. Burrrns was
Scottish, and Allan Ramsay, and Blair, and
Thomson, Smollett, and Hume, and Boswell,
and Adam Smith, and Stewart, and Hogg,
and Campbell; and ay, Sir Walter Scott,
Tam Carlyle, and Lord Brougham; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Chalmers, and Brewster, and Lyell, and
Livingstone, and Macbeth, and McGinnis;
Macchiaveli, the Maccabees; and Macaronis,
the Macintoshes and Macrobes; and what
reason hae ye to suppose that the author of
Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite> was an exception?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," I said, "but&mdash;er&mdash;have
I had the pleasure of meeting you before?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said he, hastily dancing a strathspey,
"ma fute is on ma native dew, ma
name is Roderick; I am," he continued,
drawing himself up to the full height of his
figure, which was about six inches, "I am
the Speerit o' Scottish Literature."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you now," I said, "you're
the spirit men call the Small Scotch."</p>

<p>"Where will ye find the Small Scotch
that's fu' sax inches in height?" answered
Roderick, with asperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," I said. "But
I didn't ring for you, did I?"</p>

<p>"I'm no slave o' the ring," proudly answered
Roderick, as he broke into the opening steps
of a complicated sword-dance. "I came of
my ain sweet will, just to improve your
mind."</p>

<p>"That's very kind," said I; "will you take
a chair, or a tumbler?"</p>

<p>The Spirit hissed angrily, as if a small soda
had been poured over him, and I prudently
abstained from further interruptions.</p>

<p>As some of my readers are perhaps less
fluently acquainted with the Scotch than
myself, I take the liberty of translating into
English the conversation which ensued.</p>

<p>The Spirit began by asking whether I
regarded Shakespeare as the greatest poet
that ever lived, or as the meanest sweater
that ever exploited the gifts of the helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
poor&mdash;meaning in this case Francis
Bacon.</p>

<p>I responded that I did <em>not</em> think Bacon a
man of that sort.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the Spirit, "do you
think that a man who could scarcely write
his own name could write <cite>Hamlet</cite>?"</p>

<p>"It is a nice point," I said.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Spirit, dancing a
series of fantastic Highland flings in the
unsubstantial air, and turning a double
somersault at the finish; "if, as everybody
admits, Bacon was one of the blackest
scoundrels that ever lived, his mind could
not have conceived the noble philosophy to
which his name is attached. And if Shakespeare,
as the signature to his will shows,
could scarcely write his own name, he could
not have written his own <cite>Plays</cite>."</p>

<p>"Same again," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides which," continued the Spirit,
"neither Shakespeare nor Bacon was a
Scotsman."</p>

<p>"That settles 'em," quoth I.</p>

<p>"Now, look at here," continued the Spirit,
aggressively shaking his forefinger under my
nose; "whoever wrote Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite>
must have written Shakespeare's <cite>Sonnets</cite>."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said I.</p>

<p>"And the <cite>Sonnets</cite> were dedicated by the
publisher to 'W. H.,' who is styled 'the
onlie begetter of these ensuing <cite>Sonnets</cite>.'"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The publisher must have known who the
author was."</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"And in referring to the '<em>onlie</em> begetter,'
he clearly implies that the authorship was
claimed by many, and in furnishing no more
than the initials of 'the onlie begetter,' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
indicates that the real author had reasons
for concealing the authorship."</p>

<p>"That may be so."</p>

<p>"Well, why should a man desire to conceal
his authorship of such exquisite sonnets&mdash;sonnets
of whose surpassing excellence he
himself is so convinced that he writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long lives this,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">&mdash;unless the <cite>Sonnets</cite> contained matter likely
to bring him into trouble? For instance,
if a man had, in the fervour of his youth,
poured out such warm expression of his
love as the <cite>Sonnets</cite> contain, and very
earnestly desired, later on in life, to marry
another lady, he might be anxious then that
the authorship of the <cite>Sonnets</cite> should be
temporarily forgotten. But Bacon never did
marry. And Shakespeare married young,
and deserted his wife; and she survived his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
death. Therefore, no such motive for
secrecy could have affected Bacon or
Shakespeare."</p>

<p>At this point of his inductive reasoning,
the Spirit paused for effect: he looked for
all the world like a picture I had seen in the
<cite>Strand Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "I know you now; you
are Sherlock Holmes, the detective."</p>

<p>At which he was so indignant that he
angrily pirouetted himself right out of sight.
But he re-appeared almost immediately, and
went on as if nothing had happened:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having proved to you that neither
Bacon nor Shakespeare wrote his own works,
I will now proceed to tell you who wrote
them."</p>

<p>"What! The lot?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. The similarity of thought
in Bacon's <cite>Essays</cite> and Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
prove that they were written by the same
man. That man, as you may see by the
legal knowledge betrayed alike in the <cite>Plays</cite>
and the <cite>Essays</cite>, must have studied the law.
But if he wrote all the books which I
attributed to him, he could not have had
time to practise it. Moreover, in the
atmosphere of the law courts a man could
have preserved neither the exquisite sweetness
nor the human grandeur of the so-called
Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite>."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," said I.</p>

<p>"Very well," continued Roderick, curveting
so swiftly that even as one foot touched
the floor the other seemed to be kicking the
ceiling, "we have now established these
facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, that the initials of the author of
the so-called Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite> are 'W. H.'</p>

<p>"Secondly, that he had an intensely painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
love affair in his youth, and married another
woman in his later years.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, that he was a lawyer by education
but not by practice.</p>

<p>"Now, who was he? We have yet more
evidence to aid us in identifying him.
There's Spenser's plaint that 'our pleasant
Willy,' 'the man whom Nature's self had
made to mock herself and truth to imitate,'
had been 'dead of late,' and 'with him all
joy and merriment.' We have also the lines
in the <cite>Sonnets</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Make but my name thy love and love that still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then thou lov'st me, for my name is Will.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The first name of 'W. H.,' therefore, is Will.
And this Will had great trouble at one
period of his life, which silenced all his joy
and merriment. Again I ask you, Who was
the man?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>And the Spirit, bubbling and shaking
with eagerness, peered anxiously into my
face.</p>

<p>"What great Scotsman of that great
period," he continued, screaming rather than
speaking, "was brought up to the law and
abandoned it for the pursuit of literature and
poetry? was driven nearly to distraction by
the loss of a mistress whom he loved more
dearly than life? went abroad to seek solace,
and, returning after many years, married
another lady? wrote and left extant in his
own name, sonnets which are acknowledged
to be perfect models of sweetness and
delicacy, sonnets which have never been
eclipsed since his death? who was the
Scottish poet, friend of the London actors;
friend of Ben Jonson; the man who has
left on record in British literature the report
of his conversations with Jonson; the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who, as you have to-night seen by your
landlord's letter, knew Shakespeare and lent
him plays which are not known now by the
names they then bore&mdash;come, come, man,
who is this W. H.? Cannot you guess it
even now?"</p>

<p>"William of Hawthornden?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," the Spirit cried.
"Look you, now, how plain it is. William
Drummond of Hawthornden was tinged
with the conceits and romances of the
Italian school, as was the author of <cite>Romeo
and Juliet</cite>. He wrote histories, as did the
author of <cite>The History of Henry VII.</cite>,
attributed to Bacon; as did the author of
the historical plays, attributed to Shakespeare.
He wrote many reflections on Death, as did
the author of the <cite>Sonnets</cite> and the <cite>Plays</cite>.
And who but a Scotsman, I would like you
to tell me, could have furnished the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
colour and the Scottish character to the
tragedy of <cite>Macbeth</cite>?"</p>

<p>"Why, man, it's as plain as a pikestaff.
The greatest Englishman that ever lived
was naturally a Scotsman. The greatest
genius of any clime or time was William
Drummond of Hawthornden."</p>

<p>And, in the frenzy of his exultation,
Roderick leaped high again into the air,
turned seventeen somersaults in succession,
and, alighting upon my nose, danced
a wild Highland fling of triumph and
defiance.</p>

<p>It was certainly very plausible&mdash;as plausible,
at least, as any argument that I had
heard in support of the theory that Bacon
wrote Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite>. I was almost
persuaded: then a difficulty occurred to me.</p>

<p>"But," I said, "Drummond of Hawthornden
was not born till 1585, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite> appear to have been
produced before 1593."</p>

<p>"Well," answered the Spirit, carelessly
sticking his sword into my nose and sitting
on it, "what has age to do with genius?
Has not another poet said, 'He was not of
an age, but for all time'? Besides, the
Scottish are a precocious people and byordinar'.
And furthermore, who told you
that Drummond was born in '85?"</p>

<p>"English history says so."</p>

<p>"English history!" answered the Spirit,
with a sneer; "try Scotch."</p>

<p>"But," I still objected, "if Shakespeare
wrote nothing, why did Ben Jonson, who
knew him well, praise his wit and his 'gentle
expressions, wherein he flowed with that
facility that sometimes it was necessary he
should be stopped'?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Roderick, "and who said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that Shakespeare wrote nothing? I only said
he did not write Shakespeare's <cite>Works</cite>. But
he wrote other poetry&mdash;poetry which everybody
knows&mdash;poetry as familiar in every
child's mouth as butterscotch. There is
nothing finer of its kind."</p>

<p>"It is strange," I muttered, "that I have
never heard of it."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the Spirit, "never heard
of 'Little Jack Horner'?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Little Jack Horner sat in a corner<br /></span>

<p>"And is that Shakespeare's?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And what for no'? It is a perfect
specimen of pure Anglo-Saxon English,
without corrupt admixture of Norman or
Roman words. It is terse and dramatic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The very first line, in its revelation of the
hero's remote and solitary state, presents
a powerful suggestion of a contemplative
character. His voracity, tempered by intense
conscientiousness, is indicated in a few clear,
pertinent touches that unmistakably betoken
the master-hand. Yet the author's
name is lost in the dust of the centuries; it has
eluded the vigilance of antiquarian research.
Only I am acquainted with the secret. If
you doubt it, turn the poem into an anagram,
and the truth shall be clear even to
you."</p>

<p>"But," I began, "if"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bah! Look at here!" cried Roderick,
jumping to his feet and brandishing his
sword, "I came here to improve your mind;
but if you are not amenable to reason, it's
no use talking. So get out of it, ye puir,
daft, gawkie Southron loon!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>And so saying, he struck me so terrible a
blow across the nose with his sword that I
sneezed, and lo, behold! he was gone, and
in the place where he had been, was nothing
but a great, busy, buzzing moth, that hovered
round my nose as though it had been a
joy-beacon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a strange experience. I don't
know what to make of it. But I don't think
that Shakespeare was Bacon. And, as I
hadn't the slightest trace of headache when
I awoke, I think that, after all, the Scottish
Spirit was right. Bacon hasn't a ham to
stand on. Bacon is smoked. To honest
nostrils Bacon hereafter is rancid.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there can be no
doubt henceforth as to the authorship of
"Little Jack Horner." Following Roderick's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
instructions, I have taken the letters of the
lines of that poem, and have constructed
with them an anagram which establishes
beyond possibility of dispute that Shakespeare
wrote them.</p>

<p>I am prepared to prove it to the British
Association, and defy <cite>The Daily Chronicle</cite>.
It is true the spelling is rather bad, but
Shakespeare's was notoriously beastly, so that
is another proof in my favour.</p>

<p>It is moreover a perfect anagram, in which
each letter is used, and used once only.
The letters are <em class="gesperrt">Little jack horner
sat in a corner eating a christmas
pie he pulled out a plum
with his finger and thumb and
said what a good boy am i</em>.</p>

<p>Now, mark, hey presto! there's no deception;
mix these letters and form them into
new combinations, and you evolve this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
remarkable, startling, conclusive, and scientifically

<h2>FLEET STREET</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>When I go up that quiet cloistered court, running
up like a little secure haven from the stormy ocean
of Fleet Street, and see the doctor's gnarled bust
on the bracket above his old hat, I sometimes
think the very wainscot must still be impregnated
with the fumes of his seething punch-bowl.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Washington Irving.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<p>My Bosom's Lord declares that it is more of
a smell than a street; but there is not a
journalist of any literary pretension in Britain
who does not regard Fleet Street as the
Mecca of his craft, and instinctively turn
his face towards it when he has occasion
to say his prayers.</p>

<p>It is the focus, the magnetic centre, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
very heart of London's Fairyland&mdash;the
Capital of the Territory of Brick and
Mortar Romance.</p>

<p>Its enchanted courts are the inner sanctuary
of Haunted London. It is the most
astonishing sensation to step out of the
hum and moan and fret of the rushing
and turbulent City's most bustling and roaring
street, into the absolute, cloistered
stillness of, for instance, the Temple;
where, within fifty yards of Fleet Street,
you may stand by Oliver Goldsmith's
grave and hear no sound save the cooing
of pigeons and the splashing of a
fountain.</p>

<p>Fleet Street's air is the quintessence of
English History. From the Plague and the
Fire to the Jubilee Procession, everything
has passed here. All the literary eminence
of the day comes to do business here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
These paving-stones have felt the weight
of George R. Sims, Clement Scott, Bernard
Shaw, and the Poet Craig. It is the world's
main artery, the centre of the Empire's
nervous system, the brain and soul of
England.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I am conscious of
an increase in my stature since I became
a part of Fleet Street&mdash;a stretching of my
boots since I began to walk in the footsteps
of Swift, Steele, Pope, Goldsmith, Johnson,
and all the other giants whose seething
punch-bowls have impregnated the wainscot
of the neighbouring taverns.</p>

</div>

<p>The chief of the ghosts, of course, is the
burly lexicographer&mdash;the man with the inky
ruffles, the dirty large hands, the shabby
brown coat, and shrivelled wig. Methinks I
see him now, clinging to his door in dingy
Bolt Court, and waking the midnight echoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a><br /><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with his Cyclopean laughter, as he listens
to a parting from fluent Burke or snuffy
Gibbon.</p>

<p>There were no footpaths in Fleet Street
in those days; spouts projected the rain-water
in streams from the house-tops, and
there were no umbrellas. The swinging of
broad signs in high winds would sometimes
bring down a wall&mdash;an accident which
killed, on one occasion, in Fleet Street,
"two young ladies, a cobbler, and the
king's jeweller."</p>

<p>And yet the daintiest and prettiest of
women came tripping down Fleet Street,
and up the narrow court, to see the
blustering, pompous Lichfield bear; unless,
indeed, Miss Burney, witty Mrs. Montague,
charming Miss Reynolds, and shrewd Miss
Piozzi only called to caress Hodge, the
doctor's cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>(Happy thought! who knows? <span class="smcap">Mem.</span>:
<em>We</em> must get a cat.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Dr. Johnson who set the excellent
Fleet Street fashion of tempering the fierce
delights of literary achievement with staid
and lingering meditation in the pleasant
taverns.</p>

<p>In fact, the Fleet Street taverns are
visited by reverend pilgrims to this day
as monuments consecrate to the great
lexicographer; and at all times of the day
one may find faithful congregations of
Fleet Street men of letters devoutly
lingering there to pour out libations to his
glory.</p>

<p>It was at the Cheshire Cheese, whilst
the chops hissed on the grid, that Dr.
Johnson was wont to snub Boswell, quiz
Goldsmith, and brutally beat down his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
opponents with his "Why, sir," "What,
sir?" and "What then, sir?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir," he himself admitted, "I
dogmatise and am contradicted, and I love
this conflict of intellect and opinion." It
was in another tavern, up another narrow
court, that the pompous author of <cite>Rasselas</cite>
said to his delighted biographer, "Sir, give
me your hand; I have taken a liking to
you." And it was under the influence of
this place that Boswell wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The orthodox High Church sound of the Mitre,
the figure and manner of the celebrated Dr.
Johnson, the extraordinary power and precision
of his conversation, and the pride arising from
finding myself admitted as his companion, produced
a variety of sensations and a pleasing elevation of
mind beyond what I had ever before experienced.</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Dear, garrulous, faithful old Bozzy! I
have myself seen literary men mentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
elevated in the same hallowed atmosphere,
but never have I met any who expressed
his emotions with nicer precision.</p>

<p>But the first and foremost to me of all
Fleet Street's illustrious ghosts&mdash;as actual
and inevitable a feature of the famous
thoroughfare as the taverns, the restaurants,
the overhanging signs, the newspaper offices,
the Griffin, and the Law Courts&mdash;is our old
friend and colleague the Bounder.</p>

<p>I cannot walk from Ludgate Circus to
the Griffin without meeting him. I see
him stalking into Edwards', with solemn
visage and weighty stride, for the momentous
function of dinner. I see him with
beaming countenance and abdominal "Haw,
haw!" of full content, nimbly stepping out
of Bower's, his "percentage restored" and
his soul "satisfied in Nature." I see him
striding gloomily with downcast eyes, hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in fob, and bludgeon under his arm,
oblivious of the traffic and the world,
wrestling in desperate conflict with the
reluctant Muses, for a happy phrase or
eccentric rhyme.</p>

<p>His Gargantuan figure is never absent
from <em>my</em> Fleet Street. Were he to slap me
on the back, I should say "Hello, Ned,"
as naturally as if he had never left us.</p>

<p>Ah me! how we get carried away from
those by whose side we would have chosen
to fight!</p>

<p>Happily, there is no settled sadness in
the Bounder's ghost.</p>

<p>One of the earliest recollections I have
of him is connected with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> dinner
(the tater-tart came many years after) in
one of the Fleet Street taverns.</p>

<p>We had finished our ample meal, when
in came my old friend Tom Sutton, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the <cite>Athletic News</cite>, and seeing nothing but
empty plates before us, cheerily invited
us to dine.</p>

<p>I was about to explain the situation,
when the Bounder, to warn me off, winking
sideways, affably answered, "All right, old
chap. I'll have a steak and a tankard of
stout."</p>

<p>This he consumed, together with several
accessories and supplements pressed upon
his easy acquiescence by our genial host.</p>

<p>At last came the solemn moment</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">When the banquet's o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreadful reckoning, and men smile no more.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tom Sutton looked, and looked again,
pulled his moustache, and called the
waiter.</p>

<p>"I say," he protested, "there's a mistake
here. We haven't had all this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mistake, sir?" said the waiter. "No,
dere vas no mistake, sir; I haf charge for
dat gentleman all his two dinner. Dat
gentleman always have two dinner sometimes.
No mistake."</p>

<p>"Two dinners? Why"&mdash;</p>

<p>But at that moment Tom looked across
the table, saw the Bounder's huge frame
shaking with inward chuckles, which rose
to a roar as their eyes met, and then he
paid and said no more.</p>

<p>The Bounder was of course the Mentor
who introduced me to Bower's. I was
"up" for a day, and of course we "signified
the same in the usual manner."</p>

<p>"Albert," said the Bounder, "bring me
a glass of <em>my</em> port&mdash;from behind the glue-pot."</p>

<p>I said I would take the same, and put
down half a crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Albert brought tenpence change.</p>

<p>As I counted it, I began, "I say, is
this change"&mdash;</p>

<p>The Bounder, who had been watching,
at once interrupted me. "Don't expose
your untutored provincial ignorance," he
said; "tenpence a time. Always have
it with provincials. Tenpence left? Order
another."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was soon after the <cite>Clarion</cite> removed
its headquarters to London, that I paid
my first visit to the Cheshire Cheese, the
primitive tavern, with "nicely sanded floor,"
which, in a dingy Fleet Street court, still
rears its antique head in proud and successful
defiance of the gimcrack modern amply-mirrored
restaurant.</p>

<p>It was a damp, cold, miserable November
night, and I had been tramping with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
partner of my joys all day through slush
and mire in search of houses.</p>

<p>Looking in for letters at the <cite>Clarion's</cite>
gloomy little office in Bouverie Street, I
found Fay crouching disconsolately over a
handful of expiring embers in the grate.</p>

<p>He had been ill for many weeks, and
had been reduced to a painful diet of
buns and milk, but yet, if he might not
feast, he could still take an interest in
other people's feasting. Doctors could not
rob him of that comfort.</p>

<p>So he inquired with touching interest
where we proposed to dine.</p>

<p>My Bosom's Lord, with native Cornish
trend, asked where was food the cheapest.</p>

<p>"Tut tut," said the Bounder. "Are
you blessed with an appetite, yet grudge
its entertainment? Is dinner-time a time
to think of thrift? Go to, woman. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
you never give thanks? It is Saturday
night. The Cheshire Cheese pudding is
now on. Take this poor victim of your
avarice to the Cheshire Cheese, and let him
for once be decently fed."</p>

<p>"All right," answered my frugal spouse;
"if it's the Board's orders, and the Board
pays, I don't object," and with a laughing
"Good-night," she prepared to depart.</p>

<p>But as we were crossing the threshold the
Bounder stopped me. "Are you going to
the Cheese?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"Hum! and I'm doomed to the bun-and-milk
shop." His voice quivered as he spoke.
Then suddenly&mdash;"No, hang it! I'll come
with you. That doctor of mine is an ass.
I'll try the pudding."</p>

<p>And he did&mdash;several times; though I, in
robust health, could stomach no more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
one helping of the rich and bilious
compound.</p>

<p>As we came out he walked on his heels
and slapped his chest. "Haw! haw!" he
said, "I never felt better in my life. That
doctor is an ass. Bread and milk? Bah!"
And he swaggered all the way down Fleet
Street.</p>

<p>On the next evening I found him crouching
again over the little fire in Bouverie
Street. I could feel his "hump" as soon as
I opened the door. He was very bad.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old chap? Don't you
feel well?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, very ruefully; "I'm very
bad. You know, I begin to think my doctor
is a fool. I've been trying this perishing
bread-and-milk diet for nearly two months,
and, upon my word, I never felt worse.
Really, I've given this doctor a fair trial, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
hang it all, the fellow does not understand
me at all!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oh the gaps left by the passing years in a
man's little circle of friends!</p>

<p>Time was when the cordial hand-grip of
friends met me in Manchester at every
corner, and almost every face in the streets
was familiar.</p>

<p>I was there last Christmas, and I walked
for half a day without a welcoming voice or
smiling countenance to greet me. I thought
of them that I had known, and walked with,
and drank and eaten with there, and desolation
fell upon me. To stroll through the
crowded, bustling thoroughfare was like
walking through a graveyard at midnight.
The buildings loomed upon my gaze like
monuments of the departed; and the only
inhabitants I saw were spectres of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>It was holiday time, and the passers-by
were many. Their laughter sounded in my
ears like the sobbing of wind through
willows.</p>

<p>Then I fell into a cluster of survivors from
the fray, a band of staunch and hearty friends
of old, who took me by the hand and
"trated me dacent."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to see you," said one;
then another, then another, and all together
in lusty chorus.</p>

<p>That was good.</p>

<p>Then they began to talk. "Do you
remember being here with Tom Sutton on
such a night? Ah, poor old Tom! His
death was an awful shock!"</p>

<p>And, "You heard how Jones's two
boys went down in the pleasure yacht?
Jones has been out of his wits ever
since."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>And so on, and so on, till I rejoiced to
hear the signal of parting.</p>

<p>We'll have no more of these reminiscences
of graves and worms and epitaphs. "Some
grief shows much of love; but much of grief
shows still some want of wit."</p>

<p>"Hogsdon" has come to Hygate long
since, as our friend Cartmel, wearily pedalling
his bicycle through the up-piled accumulation
of dingy streets that divide his slum
from my elevated fastness, can sadly testify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Where will "she" be a hundred years
hence?</p>

<p>Where when "she" is finished?</p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p>James I. predicted that London would
shortly be England and England would be
London. Yet London in his time was
literally the village that modern facetiousness
calls it.</p>

<p>Little more than fifty years ago a magazine
writer, bewailing London's vastness, declared
that it must on no account be permitted to
grow larger. The population was then less
than a million and a half.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITEHALL IN THE REIGN OF JAMES I.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The monstrous growth which has taken
place since then and the stupendous rate
of present increase fill the thoughtful
observer with dread. The problems of
communication and distribution grow year
by year more complicated and difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a><br /><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The congestion of clever men attracted from
all parts of the country by the glitter of the
capital, impoverishes the provinces, and fills
London with starving unemployed talent,
much of which gradually degenerates into
hopeless drunkenness, or still more degraded
flunkeyism. The surplus artists, sculptors,
writers, and actors stagnating and rotting in
London would, and should, set up throughout
the counties living, healthy, beneficial
schools of art, culture, and general
enlightenment.</p>

<p>The only comfort visible in the actual
distortion is, that by its wholesale exaggeration
of the evils afflicting the whole country,
it will the more speedily bring a breakdown
of the whole system, and so precipitate its
own cure. Through the growth of population
between 1866 and 1891 the "value" of land
in London increased by £110,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Ground in the City is sold at the rate of ten
guineas per superficial foot. £16,000,000
a year is drawn as rent of land whose
agricultural value is about £16,000 a year.
That is to say, the people of London have
to pay £50 every year for what would have
cost, but for their own industry, only
one shilling.</p>

<p>But these are matters for discussion in
weightier works than mine. Here I merely
skim the surface, and catch the superficial
fact.</p>

<p>For instance, I observe that London's
growth is steadily destroying London's
picturesqueness. The embowered palaces
of dukes and earls are giving place, more
or less, to workmen's model dwellings; and
the spots, such as Charing Cross and Tower
Hill, where kings and princes were formerly
decapitated in a gentlemanly way, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
rise nowadays beyond the breaking of
the crowns of rude and clamorous
agitators.</p>

<p>Nowhere, in short, is Democracy advancing
so visibly as in London; nowhere is it so
manifestly pushing back, and crawling over,
and supplanting Aristocracy.</p>

for hundreds of years. St. Saviour's Church,
where the bones of Fletcher and Massinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and Edmond Shakespeare are laid, was built
on the site of a church built before the
Norman Conquest, from the profits of a
ferry across the Thames. Anne Boleyn had
an abode here, and hither rode the enterprising
Royal Henry to walk and talk with
her. Elizabeth came by water with the
French Ambassador to see the bull-baiting
in the building near the Globe
Theatre.</p>

<p>A famous old London tavern, the Tabard,
from which Chaucer's nine-and-twenty
pilgrims started on their journey, stood near
London Bridge within living memory. In
Southwark too, until our time, stood the
galleried inn where Mr. Pickwick discovered
Sam Weller. In fact, Southwark was, until
our time, full of historical associations, and
once ranked amongst London's most fashionable
suburbs. Now it is a labyrinth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of slums, and Barclay &amp; Perkins' brewery
occupies the site of the Bankside Globe
Theatre.</p>

<p>The narrow thoroughfares between the
Strand and the river, where modern provincial
visitors have their caravanserais,
rustled once with fashionable satins and
groaned under the weight of gilded coaches.
Here dwelt dukes and earls and the pick of

and the Pauper</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> has pictured for us a Royal
river pageant, such as many bright and flashing
eyes must have beheld from the windows
and steps of the palaces that lined the
Strand or Middlesex bank of the Thames
between London and Westminster, for the
king's town residence stood hard by in
Whitehall; and thence to his country palace
at Greenwich&mdash;Elizabeth's favourite "Manner
of Pleasaunce"&mdash;the richly caparisoned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
silk-canopied State barges fluttered splendidly.</p>

<p>Now the stateliest craft that ride the
Cockney surge are the rackety penny packet
and dingily plebeian coal barge.</p>

<p>Soho, the dingy resort of foreign refugees,
was formerly a district of great mansions,
glimpses of whose former grandeur can still
be distinguished beneath their present grime.</p>

<p>James the First's unlucky son, Henry,
Raleigh's friend and the people's favourite,
built himself a mansion in Gerrard Street,
behind the site of the present Shaftesbury
Theatre. Dryden lived in the same street,
and here stood Dr. Johnson's favourite club,
the Turk's Head.</p>

<p>Charles the Second's "natural" son, the
Duke of Monmouth, the ill-starred, ambitious
soldier who figures as the hero of Dryden's
"Absalom," and who was beheaded, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
third stroke of the axe, on Tower Hill, had a
palace in Soho Square where now stand
gloomy warehouses; and in the same square,
Sir Cloudesley Shovel, Gilbert Burnet, and
George Colman the Elder, formerly made
history and literature where Crosse &amp;
Blackwell now make pickles.</p>

<p>The whole district is, as Bottom might
have said with more than usual accuracy,
"translated." It is become the stronghold
and fastness of the foreigner and of his
cheap and excellent restaurants.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world are cheaper or
more varied dinners to be had. The odours
of the fried fish of Jerusalem here mingle
with the perfume of the sauerkraut of
Germany, and the cheeses of France and
Italy; and over all, blending them into one
harmonious whole, serenely soars the powerful
aroma of triumphant garlic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This is but one of the phases of an amazing
latter-day development of the Restaurant in
London.</p>

COURT ROAD IN 1736.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Shall I ever forget the horror of the
first dinner I ever had in England? The
Gargantuan slabs of semi-raw beef, and the
bitter, black, treacly "porter," seemed to
my mind certain signs that I had fallen
among a race of savages and cannibals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
But now, instead of the mean, dingy, dirty,
fly-blown chop-houses that formerly mocked
and balked London's appetite, we have a
collection of marble palaces, in which daintily
prepared repasts are retailed at lower prices
than were formerly charged for the chop-houses'
superannuated chunks of brutal
flesh.</p>

<p>The Adelaide Gallery, one of the largest of
these restaurants, has taken the place of a most
respectable Gallery of Practical Science, and
the Oxford Street store of the most democratic
of wine-importers grows its cobwebs in
what, fifty years ago, was accounted one of
the most fashionable resorts in Europe.
"Two thousand persons of rank and
fashion," as I read in an old magazine,
"assembled in the splendid structure" at
its opening. And it <em>was</em> a splendid structure
then, for the architect had introduced niches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
containing statues of "the heathen deities,"
with "Britannia, George <small>III.</small>, and Queen
Charlotte" thrown in! And now, I presume,
they are thrown out&mdash;or rounded off into a
perfectly harmonious circle perhaps, by a
supplemental and complementary statue of
Ally Sloper.</p>

<p>These tokens of Democracy's advance
are not unpleasing; the growth of the
restaurant tendency affords one particular
pleasure, as suggesting that the English are
losing some of their dominant insular fault
of sullen individualism, and are becoming
more healthily disposed to the communal
life.</p>

<p>Much less hopeful is the swelling grandeur
of the London gin-palace&mdash;the modern
substitute for the pleasant tavern.</p>

<p>In mediæval times, if the earle saw
a stately edifice with stained-glass windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
statuary, and everything gorgeous, he
would enter with reverence to stoop his
head; now, he goes in with fourpence to
soak it.</p>

<p>In mediæval times he would be seen
crossing himself with the holy water as he
emerged; now, as he comes out, he wipes
it off on his coat tail.</p>

<p>In mediæval times, for their sins and
sorrows and the glory of God, the nobles
built cathedrals. In this more vulgar age,
for the people's griefs and the lords'
profit, England's nobility build glorified pot-houses.</p>

<p>In mediæval times, our chivalry won their
knighthood and titles by spoiling the heathen
at the sword's point; now, they secure
peerages by spoiling English men and
women with adulterated and brutalising
liquors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>This is what we call the progress of
civilisation&mdash;</p>

<h2>A TRUCE FROM BOOKS
AND MEN</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</p>


<p>There is an old Dutch pier at Gorleston
separating the open sea from the mouth of
the river that leads to Yarmouth. It is not
ornamental; it has no pavilion, no railings,
no band, but only capstans, tarry ropes, a
small white-washed observatory, and&mdash;the
most surprising jumble of odd, cosy, sheltered
nooks overhanging the blue water, where one
may sprawl all day in any garb and any
posture, and, soothed by the sea's lullaby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
blink at the sun, or, with the aid of our
country's literature, go to sleep.</p>

<p>There is nothing to pay to go on, and our
pier is therefore frequented by no objectionable
persons. It is true there are a few
mistaken damsels who sketch or paint the
endless succession of spectacular marvels
laid on by tide and clouds; but I think they
mean no harm.</p>

<p>As for the apathetic individuals who come
with bits of string and worms, pretending to
catch fish, everybody knows that they never
do; indeed, after observing them through
several waking intervals, I have come to the
conclusion that their only object is to
politely aid our slumbers by the sight of
their languidly deliberate preparations, and
calm, leisurely hours of uninterrupted
waiting.</p>

<p>As for the rest of us, we are frankly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
honestly, disreputably lazy, and dowdily,
drowsily sprawl and dawdle the daily clock-round.</p>

<p>If the wind be southerly, we take our nap
on the river side of the pier, and open our
eyes at intervals to scan the fishing-boats
with flapping sails, as they depart to or return
from their two months' strife with wind and
wave to reap for us the harvest of the sea.
Every vessel in Yarmouth's swarming fleet
must round this pier's windy point at coming
in or going out, and cross the stream that
swiftly flows and whirls beneath our feet.
All through the day, in and out they pass,
to and from their perilous work; late at
night we hail and greet them as they glide
with majestic sail through the reflected moonbeams,
and disappear like huge, towering
phantoms into the darkness and mystery
beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>These, with a few timber-laden steamers
from Norway&mdash;their shifted cargoes, sloping
decks, and fearfully-listed hulls attesting often
to the fury of the Baltic gales&mdash;are the only
link connecting us with the far distant world
of commerce to which we once belonged.
These, and&mdash;I must not forget the great
morning and evening events of our drowsy
days&mdash;the two big passenger steamers that
set out before breakfast for Clacton and
London, and the two that heavily swing into
the narrow channel at dusk, with ever fresh
wonder to our awakened and densely
assembled holiday population.</p>

<p>When the wind is northerly we shift over
to the south side of our pier and face the
Gorleston bay and beach. Lo, what a
transformation! No trace of the workaday
world remains. A scene of pure enchantment,
of sunny brightness and rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>A semicircle of crumbling sandcliffs forms
the background of the bay; and from the
verge of a narrow streak of yellow sand,
without a pebble, stretches the green, the
blue, the yellow sea&mdash;nestling in its intimate
nooks, splashing against the wooden promenade,
or dashing with imposing affectation
of fierceness over our promiscuously scattered
breakwaters of granite.</p>

<p>We have one hotel, incongruously conspicuous
on the neck of ground dividing sea
from river at the pier's base; but we have
no theatres, no music-halls, no punch-and-judy
show, no niggers, no "amusements"
(!!!) of any sort. We have a few bathing-machines
upon the beach, and a vast
picturesque camp of bathing-tents, but not
any other sign of commercial enterprise.
There is no esplanade to swagger on; no
electric lights to set off our beauties by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
night; no illumination over all the "promenade"
and mignonette gardens and pier
after sunset, except the light of the moon
and stars.</p>

<p>We <em>can</em> see the garish lights of Yahoo
Yarmouth, flaunting through the night, two
miles away; but, if we can help it, we don't.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The only thing we do with assiduity is
bathing, unless we belong to the army of
bare-legged water-babies who unceasingly
"paddle" and build castles on the beach.</p>

<p>Sometimes we carry our day-dreams in
small boats across the glistering sea, and lazily
drift or tack before the languid breeze.</p>

<p>It has even occurred that foolish relapses
into energy have borne us upon bicycles
through leafy lanes to lazier Suffolk Broads;
but these excesses are rare and brief. No man
could face these sleepy inland waters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
preserve an active spirit; the apathetic
willows on the banks dreamily curtsey as if
too tired to hold up their heads.</p>

<p>But let Dr. Mackay, who opened this
chapter, also speak the last word&mdash;</p>

<p>What is this Life at all, and what its
purport? Is Good its aim or evil? If roses
be fair, what need of thorns? God sends
youth and health and beauty; what devil
brings sickness, grief, and decay?</p>

<p>When I wrote the irrelevant, drowsy chapter
preceding this, the sun shone so kindly, and
so benignly Nature beamed, that Care was
as a dream of what never could have
been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>To live was to be blessed; to think was
to enjoy. Nature was a doting mother that
fed us with bounty and kissed us fondly to
rest; the earth a sunny garden; heaven a
waste of luxurious fancy.</p>

<p>How blind I must have been! What a
glorious blindness it would be, if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! "If"!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My drop from the rosy clouds began
pleasantly enough. I was nooning by the
river-side, when an ancient, second-hand
Danish pirate, with improbable pantomime
whiskers, like tangled seaweed, fixedly
looking at the lower part of my waistcoat,
casually remarked, "Seems to me you're
pining away down there."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered briskly, "I'm not the
man I was."</p>

<p>"No," said he meditatively, "we're none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of us as young as we was; but, come, you
can't be more than forty-three."</p>

<p>"I am," I answered indignantly, "no
more than thirty-six."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, with what may have been
a consolatory intent, "we can't help our
looks, none of us. I'm judging you'll
not be for the lifeboat when you're my
age."</p>

<p>I had decided to speak to him no more,
but an undefined hope to get the better of
his sauciness prompted me to ask, "What
age may that be?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-five," he answered.</p>

<p>"You look," said I vindictively, "a great
deal older."</p>

<p>Scarce had the words left my mouth than
I was ashamed of them. I saw for the first
time now that he was crippled, and walked
with a stick. Rough weather and a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
life had left on him a low-water mark of rust
and wear and decay. But he answered,
gently enough, "It's like enough I may.
I've been very bad this three week. Got
tangled in a rope and fell overboard, and
was dragged ashore through the water from
the pierhead to the harbour. My uncle and
two other young fellows was in the boat,
but"&mdash;</p>

<p>The "two other young fellows" was
tempting, but I did not smile.</p>

<p>"They couldn't get me in," he continued
unconsciously, "and I got knocked about
a bit. My shoulder was main bad. I'm
crawling about again, but it's hard work
doing nothing."</p>

<p>I repeated the words to myself as I walked
away, "hard work doing nothing"&mdash;especially
when "doing nothing" means a bare
cupboard and hungry children, eh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Gorleston is perhaps not altogether so
cheerful as I thought.</p>

<p>Unsneck the door to Care and you might
as well take it off its hinges.</p>

<p>Late the same night, I was talking to the
watchman at the end of the pier. A Yarmouth
fishing-smack sailed out into the
gloom.</p>

<p>"Rough night," the watchman cried to the
skipper.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," replied a gruff voice from below;
and a moment later the smack was gone.</p>

<p>"Better here than on that boat to-night,"
I observed, as the black sail faded and
merged in the black cloud.</p>

<p>"Ay," the watchman answered; "but
they'll see worse before they see home again.
There's queer weather to be found on the
Dogger Bank in an eight weeks' trawling. I
mind me of three hundred and sixty drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in one March gale, and upwards of two hundred
lost two or three years ago one Christmas night.
Then there's always the risk of collisions in
the fog, men washed overboard in a gale, or
crippled in the small boat when they put
out, as they must whatever the weather,
when the Billingsgate steamer comes round
in the night for the fish."</p>

<p>"H'm! And what pay sends willing men
to face these risks?"</p>

<p>"Penny an hour, from time they start till
they get back. That's fourteen shilling a
week."</p>

<p>"And when they come home?"</p>

<p>"Pay stops."</p>

<p>"God! how can their women and children
live?"</p>

<p>"Nay, now you're asking something. But
they're better off than them as waits ashore
all winter, and can't get a job."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fourteen shillings! Why do they stand
it?"</p>

<p>"Because they can't help theirsels. There's
too many waiting to take t' place o' them as
has a job."</p>

<p>"Have they no trade union?"</p>

<p>"They've trouble enough to keep theirsels
in work; who'd keep them if they went on
strike?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen shillings a week! It's shameful."</p>

<p>"Happen it is, and happen the shame is
not so much the men's as yours."</p>

<p>"Mine? How?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you buy and eat fish?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and pay the price I'm asked; if I
paid twice as much, would the fishermen
get the money?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I don't know. We look to you
clever folk in London to settle these things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>They are not awe-struck by the superiority
of the "clever folk from London," these outspoken
men of the sea. From the taciturn
solitary policeman, who looks on us with
undisguised contempt, to the ancient
mariners by the river-side, who gaze on
us with the puzzled stare that a Viking
might have cast on a French dancing-master,
the natives give one the painful
impression that they regard us as prodigies
of ignorance and uselessness.</p>

<p>But&mdash;we have money. People who don't
seem to know anything or to do anything
always have. And they that have to wrest
sustenance from the churlish sea at Gorleston,
are disposed to do much for money&mdash;even
to tolerate inquisitive, pompously patronising,
incessantly cackling Cockneys.</p>

<p>I went down to the sea thinking to mend
my tired body with the blow of the lusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
spray, but I am judging 'twas perhaps my
mind most needed change of air.</p>

<p>They are not so much our lungs that get
stifled in the cities as our brains and hearts.
We are so hemmed in with glittering shams
and lies that we forget Truth's features.</p>

<p>What do we know of work and trade, we
that scramble for gold dust in London?
What do we know of Life, we that seek it
in the perfumed mire and corruption of the
West End? They are not the usurers and
money-changers that make the wealth of
nations, nor the painted splendours of Babylon
that ripen our harvests, nor the swinish
orgies of Sodom and Gomorrah that make
the pulses beat with healthy joy of life.</p>

<p>One stews in London's vitiated atmosphere,
and one forgets. One's perceptions
grow numb, and dull and blunted; one's
knowledge twisted, warped, awry. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made dizzy by the rush and whirl, and
cheated by specious shows and make-believes.
Our days and nights are passed
in fever, our thoughts are as the babbling
of a grim delirium, and there is no health
in us.</p>

<p>Contango? The odds for the Leger?
The new ballet?</p>

<p>"We went out twice that night," said the
lifeboatman; "one of our men broke his
arm th' first trip, and he wur main wild when
he couldn't go th' second time."</p>

<p>"And did you save them all?"</p>

<p>"Ay, we got 'em all off&mdash;both lots; though
they'd give up hope. They couldn't see us
till we came close up to them, for it was a
dirty night, and the sea was running high,
but they heard the cheers we give them
when we got within calling distance, poor
things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>That makes a better picture than the
Stock Exchange or Piccadilly Circus. The
thought of the ships that sink, of the men
and women and children that go down into
the cold depths, "their eyes and mouths to
be filled with the brown sea sand"&mdash;that is
not good to think of. But the picture of the
rescue, is not that glorious?</p>

<p>The sound of the human cheer across the
roar of Nature's battle&mdash;think of it in the ears
of the crew that had "given up hope"! The
thrill, the gladness, the doubt, the eager lookout.
The cheer again, clearer, huskier,
certain now, and full of brave comfort. A
chance then for life? A chance for the
wailing women and the weeping bairns?
Then a glimpse, deep down in the great
trough of the sea, of a boat staggering and
rolling amidst the waves, manfully propelled,
perceptibly approaching, despite wind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
sleet and drenching wave, with rough men's
voices giving promise of life through the
darkness of the storm!</p>

<p>Ah! gentlemen of the Spiers &amp; Pond
and money-making world, isn't it a brave
picture to think of? The cooling dash of
ocean spray is delightfully refreshing. To
think that our race can still breed heroes;
that even we, if we could or would but shake
off the Old Man of the Earth that sits upon
our shoulders, might perhaps be heroes
too; that we too might risk our lives to
snatch storm-tossed unfortunates from the
clutch of death&mdash;is it not a blessed
thought?</p>

<p>It is the custom of our age to boast of its
civilisation. When we stand erect we fear
to hurtle the stars with our foreheads as we
pass under. We smile upon our accumulations
of wealth and the monuments of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
commerce, and esteem ourselves the crowning
triumphs of evolution, the ultimate perfection,
Nature's finished masterpieces. But
how small, how mean, and how insignificant
we Londoners look by the side of these
stalwart and fearless fishermen of Suffolk and
Norfolk.</p>

<p>They know nothing of Westralians, S. P.
prices, futures, or the Sisters Bobalink's
new dance; but what a lot they have to
teach us!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The weather changes swiftly at Gorleston,
and when the white foam-horses ride over
the hidden sand-banks, even a Cockney-tripper
may feel the sense of peril.</p>

<p>Ever since we came we have seen the
gaunt masts of one wreck spectrally haunting
our feast from behind the lightship in the
east. Now there is another on a sand-bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
close to shore, a little to the north of the
river's mouth.</p>

<p>It had been a glorious day, but towards
evening the storm-clouds gathered and the
wind rose in fitful gusts. A Baltic steamer,
clearing out of the harbour at dusk, blocked
up the mouth of the river for some hours
owing to a fouled anchor, till at last, her
cable being cut, she succeeded in getting to
sea.</p>

<p>Meantime, a Yarmouth trawler, returning
to port with a week's catch of fish, was misled
by the lights of the disabled vessel, and,
man&oelig;uvring to get clear, backed on to the
dangerous North Sand, whose floor is thickly
strewed with remains of former wrecks.</p>

<p>From the pier, through the blackening
night, we watched the crew's futile efforts to
get off again. It was very like a fly's efforts
to escape from a spider's web, and evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as profitless. The more they struggled, the
deeper in the sand they sank.</p>

<p>Now, boom! through the night came the
bang of a great gun. The Admiralty men
in charge of the Board of Trade life-saving
apparatus were about to begin operations.
We saw lights flickering to and fro on the
Denes&mdash;the low bank of land between the
river and the sea. Presently, with a prodigious
whiz, up to the black sky and
across the ship shot the rocket, bearing the
lifeline that would bring the shipwrecked
mariners to land! Before this, however,
one of the five lifeboats maintained on this
dangerous coast had been safely launched
through the surf, and reached the wreck
almost as soon as the line.</p>

<p>But neither line nor boat would the
captain of the smack accept: to leave his
ship meant loss of property, and property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in England is of all things the most
sacred.</p>

<p>The night by this time had become wild
and fearful. The wind shrieked viciously;
the waves broke ashore with a hungry roar;
and from the swart clouds came down squalls
of rain, merging land and lights and sea and
sky in one blur of desolation.</p>

<p>There was no more to be seen. The
crew of the stranded trawler deemed it safe
to remain where they were. So we curious
Cockneys, perceiving no hope of further fresh
sensations, hastened us home to cosy beds
and warmth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had just gone to sleep when a boom
that shook the bed roused me with a start.</p>

<p>I jumped up and went to the window.</p>

<p>A signal-rocket had been fired from the
coastguard station opposite our lodging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="lifeboat" id="lifeboat"></a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a><br /><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>I slipped on some clothes and went out.
The night was wilder than ever, the driving
rain heavier, the wind louder, the sea rougher.
I saw the coastguard-men bury themselves in
oilskins, and sally out with lanterns to their
station on the Denes. When they took
boat to cross the river, I had perforce to
leave, and so, wet through, went back to
my bedroom window.</p>

<p>For hours I watched the fitful lights on
the Denes, and the wavering light on the
mast of the ship beyond. Once, in the
staring light of a "flare," I saw her
plainly&mdash;her stark, white, sloping deck looming
ghostly through the darkness; then,
another rocket-line went flashing across the
black waste, and I hoped the crew were safe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning I learned from our landlady's
son that he had been all night in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
lifeboat; that despite the smack-skipper's
first refusal to leave his ship the lifeboat had
stood by him for hours, the waves washing
over the stranded vessel the while; that,
at last, finding the skipper obstinate, the
lifeboatmen had returned to shore, but had
scarcely landed when the new view which
isolation lent to his perilous position, caused
the skipper to signal for their return. They
went back accordingly, and at three in the
morning safely landed the shipwrecked crew
in Gorleston.</p>

<p>All through the next day, without rest or
respite, the hardy young boatman unceasingly
engaged on salvage duty. I accidentally
heard, by the way, that on the previous
day he had plunged twice into the sea from
the breakwater to save two children who had
fallen in&mdash;for which service he was munificently
rewarded with five shillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>At night, in answer to a question, he told
me, "Sometimes in winter we've been out as
much as three times in one night, and been
at it again the night after. You soon get
used to it, you know."</p>

<p>H'm! I <em>don't</em> know: I only know that
after that night I was laid up with a chill,
whilst he made no more of his labours, his
perils and exposure than if they had been
part of a picnic; and I also know that when,
in inquiring about my health, he wistfully
struggled to tune his storm-tanned hardy
face to a note of decent sympathy, he
made me feel ashamed of my lubberly
fragility.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;tut, tut! Can I not win more pay
for a nice little cackling article about his
work, than this dreadnought will get for
saving six men's and two children's lives?</p>

<p>Since everything is justly ordained in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
best of all possible societies, my greater gain
must prove, despite appearances, that I am
this man's superior.</p>

<p>Besides, he speaks to me with manifest
respect, and calls me "Sir."</p>

<p>A few nights later, there was another gale;
a trawler was driven ashore, and her crew
saved by the rocket apparatus.</p>

<p>Two or three nights later a Lowestoft smack
was run down by a Norwegian barque, and the
skipper and mate were drowned; one left a
wife and four children, the other a wife and
nine!</p>

<p>These casualties are happening constantly&mdash;they
are so common they are scarcely
reported, even in local papers; but what
becomes of the widows and orphans?</p>

<p>A man's wages on the trawlers are 14s. a
week, <em>when his boat is at sea</em>.</p>

<p>"They ought to be included in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Compensation Act," I suggested to a boatman.</p>

<p>"Who is to pay the compensation?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I suggested the smack owners.</p>

<p>"Oh, they couldn't afford it"; they
couldn't afford more wages; couldn't afford
anything. They also were to be numbered
amongst those deserving unfortunate classes
of disinterested British capitalists who are
living on their losses. Yet one doesn't hear
of <em>their</em> starving in the winter, of <em>their</em> being
drowned in quest of a precarious livelihood,
of <em>their</em> widows and orphans being gathered
into the workhouse. Nor the boatbuilders,
nor the sailmakers, nor the Billingsgate
"wholesalers," nor any of the men connected
with the trade, except those who do the
actual work of catching the fish.</p>

<p>Their poverty is apparent to all the world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the difficulty of getting even a bare living by
the fisheries is bringing competition for
employment even into the lifeboat. Lifeboatmen
may earn 30s. in a winter's night
by going out to a wreck, and may get as
much as £10 per man in one haul if they
recover salvage. That is "big money" to
fishermen; so it comes to pass that even
that business is tarnished with a sordid
taint.</p>

<p>"The coastguard had no business to fire
their rocket-line," said a fisherman to me,
speaking of the wreck above described; "we
was in the water first and was entitled to the
pay. Besides," he continued, following up a
train of thought which is horrible to pursue,
"they needn't be in such a hurry to take
the bread from us lifeboatmen: <em>it's only
half a crown each they'd get for firing the
rocket</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>I heard ugly hints of vessels purposely
cast away to recover insurance; and I heard
a well-dressed townsman, who spoke with
considerable warmth, and evidently with
knowledge, utter bitter sneers at the rapacity
of certain boatmen who had "made salvage
a business," and who "always won their
actions-at-law against the owners because
counsel artfully worked on the jurymen's
feelings by glowing accounts of the men's
pluck and perils."</p>

<p>"And do you deny the peril of the work?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted, "it's risky enough,
but it pays better than fishing, and that's
about as risky."</p>

<p>"You would not care to do it yourself, I
presume?"</p>

<p>"Not me!" he answered, with a chuckle;
"I should hope I'd got a better mark on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
But to make a ten-pound note, those beggars,
why, they'd face hell!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If there be a devil his name is Money.</p>

<p>Fresh from the hands of the gods, we are
the exquisite instruments upon which they
play divine music. But comes Money to
play upon us, and the strings become jangled,
harsh, and out of tune. If there were no
money&mdash;if none were tempted for lack of it
to sell themselves, if none were driven by
excess of it to wallow in porcine gutters&mdash;how
brave, noble, and lovable were
Man!</p>

<p>The stock question that Yorkshire weavers
ask of one another on meeting, is one we
might fitly ask of our Civilisation, "What
soorts are yo' makin' now?"</p>

<p>The nearer the knuckle of civilisation we
seek, the less shall we find of the cool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
fearless, manly air of my Gorleston lifeboatman.</p>

<p>Civilisation is not making those "soorts,"
Nature preserves the monopoly of manufacture;
civilisation succeeds only in spoiling
them.</p>

<h2>LONDON PRIDE AND COCKNEY
CLAY</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From drinking fiery poison in a den<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowded with tawdry girls and squalid men,<br /></span>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">James Thomson.</span>
</p>


<p>Since I met the Lancashire excursionist at
Lowestoft I have been wondering what is the
essential distinction between the Cockney-tripper
and the holiday-maker one meets at
New Brighton, Douglas, or Blackpool.</p>

<p>We were tightly packed in the shelter on
the promenade waiting the end of the
thunderstorm. There were two native boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
singing a temperance song to the tune of
"There's nae luck aboot the hoose," translated
to a dirge with a drawling refrain of
"No d-r-r-rink! no d-r-r-rink for me!"</p>

<p>This they would whisperingly sing, with
stealthy inquiring glances at the people who
pressed about them, and then hysterically
giggle. But the stolid, respectable crowd of
"visitors" from London, stiff with the recent
dignity of seeing their names printed in the
visitors' list (with "Esquire" at the end!)
would not stoop to notice these frivolous
ebullitions. They stolidly glowered with
heavy impassive glare, oblivious, it seemed,
not only of the boys, but also of each other.</p>

<p>Now this starchiness would not have been
remarkable in Southport or Folkestone, where
one meets so many pompous, old, superior
persons, puffed up with the importance of
their little pension, annuity, or snug, retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hoard; nor in Scarborough, where many
visitors are genuine "toffs," and naturally
privileged to look down upon the common
herd.</p>

<p>But this crowd at Lowestoft consisted
unmistakably of the genteel working class&mdash;the
clerks at £150 to £300 a year, the
small shopkeepers, the&mdash;in short, the genteel
working class.</p>

<p>In Lancashire this class, though disposed
to a sort of blunt arrogance at home,
become humanised when holiday-making.
They will condescend to fuse with their
"inferiors," and when united, as in this
case, by common misfortune, they will even
condescend to be affable.</p>

<p>Not so the genteel workman of Cockaigne.</p>

<p>That he is a workman he never remembers;
that he is genteel he never forgets.</p>

<p>Even when he has divested himself of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
customary frock-coat and tall silk hat, he
remains still clothed with his cumbrous and
sombre gentility. It is to him as valour was
to his forebears. It serves him in lieu of
honour or religion. His gentility is of his
possessions the most sacred: rather than
that, he would lose his honesty, his manliness,
and his humanity.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the irruption
of a bustling newcomer, who, as he shook
his dripping cap, cheerily cried, "Good
Laur! it does come down!"</p>

<p>He looked round for acknowledgment,
but the genteel gentlemen from London
stonily stared into vacancy.</p>

<p>Undiscouraged, the newcomer took off his
mackintosh, offered a jest about the weather,
beamed cordially upon the crowd, and playfully
cuffed the ears of the boy who demanded,
"No d-r-r-rink, no d-r-r-rink for me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," he said, "if you don't want
any drink, you needn't cry about it. I'll
take your share when the whisky comes."</p>

<p>Again he glanced round with an inviting
smile, but the petrified images looked
remote, unfriendly, melancholy, slow.</p>

<p>But this chilliness troubled him no more
than a frosty morning troubles the jovial
sun. He beamed and glowed and laughed
and talked, and, despite themselves, the
genteel glaciers thawed.</p>

<p>"That man," I said to myself, "comes
from the North."</p>

<p>His next speech told of storms he had
seen&mdash;at Blackpool! of seas washing over
the promenade wetting him "three streets
back."</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen from London cast
a look of curiosity.</p>

<p>The man from the North went on to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
how he had taken a day's sail from Blackpool,
and, being unable to land there at night, had
been carried to Fleetwood, and thence back
by rail after midnight.</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked the gentleman
who had looked interested; "haven't they
a pier at Blackpool?"</p>

<p>Fancy that to a Blackpoolite! It was as
if one had asked a sailor whether he had
ever seen the sea, a Scotch reporter
whether he had tasted whisky, a French soldier
whether he had ever heard the "Marseillaise,"
or a Southport man whether he knew
what sand was.</p>

<p>It did my heart good in that strange land
upon that cheerless day to hear the man
from the North pour out his volcanic
eloquence in Blackpool's praise.</p>

<p>I grieve to be compelled to admit
that some of his statements struck me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
inaccurate. For instance, I thought he
was wrong in describing the promenade
as ten miles long, and I think he was
not justified in stretching the Tower to
double the height of the Eiffel Tower in
Paris.</p>

<p>I cast a glance of mild rebuke upon him
when he added that the Winter Gardens
were "something like the Crystal Palace,
and Earl's Court put together," and I gasped
when he represented Uncle Tom's Cabin as
"a sort of shandygaff of Buckingham Palace
and Olympia!".</p>

<p>I felt that if I didn't check him the man
would rupture himself.</p>

<p>I touched him on the shoulder. "I have
lived at Blackpool myself," I said.</p>

<p>"There you are," he continued, without
turning a hair; "this gentleman will confirm
what I'm telling you. Aren't all these South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of England watering-places slow as compared
with Blackpool?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "none of them have such
variety of amusements."</p>

<p>"If you want amusement," said the
Cockney gentleman who had offered the cue
about the pier, "if you want amusement,
you should try Yarmouth."</p>

<p>"Yarmouth!" cried the North of England
man, with an expression of superb disdain.
"Bah! Yarmouth is vulgar!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was lovely! After his praise of Blackpool
it was sublime. I saluted him respectfully
and departed with a soul full of awe.</p>

<p>For I had not then seen Yarmouth. On
the next day I did.</p>

<p>Then my wonder vanished.</p>

<p>I had seen something of the Yarmouth
yahoos at Gorleston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>For the democratic price of twopence,
steamers bring them up the river, past the
teeming wharves and shipbuilding yards of
the Yare, and belch them forth to stare
upon Gorleston's "slowness."</p>

<p>Our placid Gorleston sun smiled on their
hurry and pain with its customary calm
complacency. Our lazy Gorleston sea
rocked itself benignly with its usual hushing
swish. Our deliberate Gorleston sea-gulls
indolently flapped their wings.</p>

<p>And the Yarmouth yahoos yawned and
hastened away in disgust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But at Yarmouth, their feet are, as it
were, upon their own wicket; their deportment
was to the manner born.</p>

<p>See them shying at skittles or cocoanuts,
gorging on stout and shellfish, bustling,
breathless but roaring, from "entertainment"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to "entertainment." How hot
they look! how they perspire! and how
they shout! Do they really amuse themselves?
I wonder.</p>

<p>They all seek happiness, these good
brothers and sisters of ours; but surely
they run away from it that so distress themselves
in its pursuit. To "get on," to "do"
the utmost possible in the shortest possible
time, to eclipse their fellows, to make haste
and yet more haste, and ever more haste&mdash;that,
in pleasure as in toil, is ever their aim.</p>

<p>For a right-down, regular, blaring, flaring,
glaring, tearing, staring, devil-may-caring
hullabaloo, Blackpool on August Bank
Holiday is peculiar.</p>

<p>But between the Lancashire and the
Cockney-tripper there is an essential
difference which is not in the Southerner's
favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The Northern tripper may be rowdy, but
there is a redeeming quality of broad joviality,
good-tempered companionship in his razzling,
that mellows and softens its asperity. But
the Cockney-tripper, from his exasperating
accent to his infuriating concertina, is
aggressively, blatantly, harshly coarse.
There is a self-sufficient "cockiness" about
him that soars above all compromise and
defers to nothing and to nobody. His
profanity is more raucous and vicious than
the Northerner's, his ebriety more ribald,
brutal, and swinish. Armed with his
customary concertina, or his still more
harrowing occasional cornet, 'Arry is a terror
to shudder at.</p>

<p>His 'Arriet, too, is infinitely coarser than
the worst specimen of the Lancashire
mill-girl.</p>

<p>The shrieking sisterhood of the flaunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
feathers and marvellously beaded and bugled
tippets, swagger along in serried bands, five
and six feet deep. Arm in arm they come,
lifting their skirts high in impudent dance as
they lurch to and fro, giggling hysterically,
and shouting vocal inanities with shrill and
piercing insistence.</p>

<p>There is nothing more distressing in all
England than the spectacle of these unfortunate
persons in their hours of mirth.
In all England there is no poverty more
pitiful than the conspicuous poverty of their
resources of pleasure.</p>

<p>To raise as much noise as they can, to
make themselves as offensive as possible to
the quietly disposed, to spoil natural beauties
and break things,&mdash;these seem to be the
aims of their enjoyment.</p>

<p>If they find a pleasant stretch of clean
sand, where barefooted children happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
disport themselves, they will fill the place
with lurid profanity, and departing leave
behind them a Tom Tiddler's heap of
broken bottles, threatening the security and
comfort of every playing baby in the
neighbourhood. If they find a pretty flower-garden,
where they are politely requested to
"keep off the grass," they will deliberately
and purposely trample on the sequestered
patch, to prove their insolent superiority over
regulations framed for their and the general
public's profit and advantage.</p>

<p>Oh, but it is sad to see! There is nothing
more depressing, more crushing to one's
aspirations for the people's greater and
truer liberty.</p>

<p>The usurer's greed, the tyranny of upstart
wealth, labour's subjection and dependence,
poverty's hunger&mdash;all these may be cured;
but what shall be done with yahoos whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
chief delight lies in spoiling the enjoyment
of others?</p>

<p>Ah, me! I wish I had not been to
Yarmouth.</p>

<h2>MY INTRODUCTION TO
RESPECTABILITY</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>It was a Sunday in London&mdash;gloomy, close, and
stale. Maddening church bells of all degrees of
dissonance, sharp and flat, cracked and clear, fast
and slow, made the brick and mortar echoes hideous.
Melancholy streets, in a penitential garb of soot,
steeped the souls of the people who were condemned
to look to them out of windows in dire despondency.
In every thoroughfare, up almost every alley, and down
almost every turning, some doleful bell was throbbing,
jerking, tolling, as if the plague were in the city, and
the dead-carts were going round. Everything was
bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish
relief to an overworked people.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<p class="noind">When, as a boy of ten (driven from Paris
by General Trochu's proclamation before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the siege as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouche inutile</i>), I first set my
eyes on the world's metropolis, my impressions
were not favourable. Ugh! that first
Sunday in London! It was like a day of
death, a day among the tombs.</p>

<p>What a change from the Paris of the
Third Empire!</p>

<p>I had been suddenly translated from an
airy, flower-festooned apartment overlooking
the Luxembourg Gardens, to a dirty brick
lodging-house in the Pentonville Road, with
a soot-garden in front and a dingy penitentiary
across the way.</p>

<p>Never before had I seen a brick house,
soot-garden, or penitentiary; and novelty for
once failed to lure my youthful eye.</p>

<p>It was then that the purple-faced landlady
in the rusty black gown assured my father
that the place was "exceedingly respectable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?" asked my elder brother
John in French&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c'est tres quoi?</i>"</p>

<p>"Respectable," repeated my father.</p>

<p>"Respectable," quoth John. "What we
call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">triste, hein</i>?"</p>

<p>And my father, who was ever grave as a
tetrarch, smiled.</p>

<p>I knew only two or three English phrases
then, such as "I am pretty and vell; how
vos you?" "If you please," "menny of
zem," etc. etc.</p>

<p>Never till then had I heard the British
national word; and when my father explained
that "respectability" meant "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">une
nature honorable</i>," we boys looked out at the
soot-garden and penitentiary, and marvelled
why honour in London looked so dirty.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and our landlady
furnished us with the name of a "most
respectable" church near Clerkenwell Prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>But John expressed a suspiciously fervent
and pious desire to attend service at St.
Paul's Cathedral, and when my mother
looked hard at him he blushed. That
settled it. I was ordered to put on my new
Sunday boots, and go with him.</p>

<p>When we got outside, John took the precaution,
by way of a start, to box my ears
for being an artful little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchard</i>, and
then set off as fast as he could go, with a
view to leaving me behind.</p>

<p>His legs were long, mine were short, and
I wore my Sunday boots. Besides, I was
hindered by rude insular boys, who stood
in my way pointing to my Parisian headgear,
and shouting barbarian phrases which
I have since recognised as "Who's your
'atter?"</p>

<p>We ran, as I have since ascertained,
through Euston Square, Tavistock Square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Bloomsbury Square, Bedford Square, twice
round Russell Square, and then somehow
got back to Euston. Then John stopped.
The fact was he was lost. But he put a
bold front on the matter, and said we would
go and dance with the London 'prentice lads
and fair-haired Saxon maids, first at Westminster
and then at Tower Green. He
told me he had seen pictures in which the
youth of Britain, in gaily-coloured attire,
were shown dancing round garlanded and
festooned poles. He fancied the sports
were held at Westminster. But was sure
some were held on Tower Hill. Was I
brave enough to join the venture and risk
the after-part?</p>

<p>I was a nice, well-meaning boy, but before
his dazzling array of temptations I fell at
once.</p>

<p>John knew a little English&mdash;learnt at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Lycée St. Louis&mdash;but, as he confided to me
after several interviews with the ignorant
Londoners, these persons did not understand
their own tongue; and it seemed to take a
long time to teach it them.</p>

<p>So we trudged again through the dreadful,
dreary, desolate squares, with their carefully
railed regulation patches of soot-gardens, and
indefinable, uniform air of hypochondriacal
blight.</p>

<p>I believe we should have walked round and
round those grim and forbidding dwelling-boxes
all day, had we not, after many
attempts, discovered a man who knew a
little French, and who offered to take us
down to Westminster.</p>

<p>John asked him about the Squares. "Are
they barracks?" he said, "or workmen's
dwellings?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, non</i>," answered our guide, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
shocked, "they are the dwellings of the most
respectable people."</p>

<p>Again that mystic word "respectable."
Again the atmosphere of dignified dumps
and dingy sulkiness. And father had told
us that "respectability" was "an honourable
nature." London honour seemed a sad
thing.</p>

<p>The story of that day's spree ought to
be published as a Sunday-school tract. It
was the most chastening experience I ever
underwent.</p>

<p>A few months later we were in the midst
of barricades and street massacres in Paris;
but even that weird experience has left no
such impression of blank and heavy gloom
upon my memory as the dismal reconnaissance
into the London Sabbath and British respectability
whereof this is the true account.</p>

<p>Those miles of deserted and colourless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
streets under the narrow glimpses of leaden
sky, with the solitary heavy figure of the
large British policeman everlastingly in the
foreground&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu!</i> in what clammy,
icy bands of unrelieved wretchedness they
strangled the exuberance of our boyish
hearts upon that dull September Sunday!</p>

<p>Besides, I wore my Sunday boots.</p>

<p>The man who spoke French, or who, at
least, understood some of John's English,
left us at Charing Cross, and we went on
alone to the joyous dance and revels of
Westminster.</p>

<p>John had mentioned them to the man, so
far as his resources would allow; but the
man only shook his head and muttered
something about Cremorne, which John
explained to me, must be the name of the
queen of the revels.</p>

<p>And when we got there&mdash;oh dear! oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
dear!&mdash;frosty-faced, dun-coloured, British
matrons and virgins with ivory-backed prayer-books
were streaming out of the Abbey, and
a drizzling chilly rain and mist had begun to
fall over the scene, when John, distracted
and discomfited, stumbled over the boots of
the customary policeman.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Milles pardons!</i>" said John, lifting his
hat, "but ve seek vere ze girls and boys
dance ze Sunday."</p>

<p>"Daunce!" replied the heavy policeman,
"daunce a' Sundays? Nice, respectable
little boys you must be, I down't think!"</p>

<p>We didn't understand all he said, but we
heard the chilly word "respectable," and
didn't get warm again till we had run to the
City.</p>

<p>To tell all the adventures of that terrible
day would be to repeat, with variations, the
tale I've told so far. The City finished our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
spirits. Even liquorice-water would not
raise one's courage in these "catacombs
with the roof off," as John aptly described
the tomb-like streets.</p>

<p>And the Tower, which John had represented
to me as a sort of Versailles or
Fontainebleau, with fountains, flower-beds,
and avenues on the exterior, and British
lions, crowns, and a plentiful supply of
beheaded traitors constantly on view inside,
was the last straw.</p>

<p>It was, as the usual policeman told John,
"closed on Sundays."</p>

<p>Then I fell upon a seat, repentant, and
vowed I'd tell my mother.</p>

<p>Finally, we compromised, on my brother's
promising to pay the omnibus fare home,
for the which I was to declare that we had
lost our way, and to deny that we had been
upon the spree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt that I could do this without injury
to my conscience, and when we returned to
the soot-garden I did it.</p>

<p>John got a hiding all the same, and I
didn't offer myself as a substitute; for
my feet were very sore, and I felt that
he was a wicked boy who deserved all
the chastisement he could get.</p>

<p>In the days which followed, my understanding
of "respectability" was much
ripened.</p>

<p>There was another family in the house.</p>

<p>Its head was a fat old lady with corkscrew
ringlets (I'd never seen corkscrew
ringlets before), who sat everlastingly in
front of the fire, like Patience in a hair-seated
rocking-chair (I'd never seen a hair-seated
chair before), toasting endless slices of
bread (I'd never seen toast before). There
were her two thin, middle-aged, maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
daughters, who were perfect types of the
British old maid (and I'd never seen an
old maid before). There was also a son,
who washed up the pots, and occasionally
went out into the garden to feed the hens,
dressed in a pair of shabby gaiters, a rusty
tall hat, and a cane.</p>

<p>The landlady informed us that they were a
family of the highest respectability. They
never paid any rent, and owed money to all
the tradesmen in the neighbourhood; but
they always went to church on Sundays and
were most respectable people.</p>

<p>My mother asked why the son didn't go to
work.</p>

<p>"Work?" said the landlady, with a pitying
smile. "None of the Ropers were ever
known to work. The family is too respectable."</p>

<p>There was another thing I saw for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
time in that house, and that was a drunken
woman.</p>

<p>The landlady, robbed of rent and food by
the Ropers, who were too respectable to be
turned out, had grown poor and dismal, and
had taken to pawn her belongings for gin.
I had never heard of gin before, nor ever
seen a gin-palace. It was our landlady who
bribed me for the first time to enter a
London public-house&mdash;a flaring, reeking,
typical London gin-palace. The sight and
smell of the place filled me with a loathing
which I have never forgotten.</p>

<p>But "here's a penny for yourself," said
she, "and it's a most respectable house."</p>

<p>And that was my first introduction to
English respectability.</p>

<p>No wonder that I preferred Parisian
wickedness!</p>

<h2>PARIS REVISITED</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Other days come back on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With recollected music, though the tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dying thunder on the distant wind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig1">
<span class="smcap">Byron.</span>
</p>


<p>The stock-in-trade of the ten-a-penny poets
includes a serviceable allusion to the
pleasure derivable from a re-visit, after a
prolonged absence to a familiar scene of
earlier years.</p>

<p>The wanderer, returning in a snowstorm,
sees the dear old gables from afar, bathed in
tender memories and moonshine. The snow
lies in crystal heaps on the well-remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
window-sill; and the apple-trees in the backyard
are loaded with frequent blossom.
The boats are darting o'er the curly bay, the
nightingales are singing blythe and free, the
little lambs on the icy peaks skip up and
down the flowering willow, and the wanderer's
aged parents are standing on their heads
under the ancestral fig-tree.</p>

<p>And as the ten-a-penny poet gazes,
enraptured, upon this pleasing spectacle from
a conveniently adjacent mountain summit,
his bosom heaves with many a joy, he flings
his pack upon the grassy sward, and he too
dances a festal hornpipe upon his head.</p>

<p>If admirers of ten-a-penny poetry had
anything to think with, they would resent
this crude and humiliating imposition.</p>

<p>I protest that the scenes of earlier joys are
always, and in the nature of things, a delusion
and a snare. That vast and luscious orchard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
so long and so fondly remembered, turns out
to be no more than a scrubby clump of woebegone
bearers of tasteless, sapless pears and
wooden apples. The main street that we
thought so wide and grand and gay, is a
narrow, dirty, straggling collection of dingy,
fly-blown marine stores and reach-me-down
contraptions. The toffee-shop&mdash;the Star of
the East, that glorious palace of delight&mdash;is
a ramshackle, tumbledown hovel, with a
stock of sloppy, sticky, sickly brandy-balls,
and soiled peppermints. The confectioner's&mdash;ah,
woe is me!</p>

<p>When I lived in Paris, as a boy, what a
mad, merry, reckless place it was! How
admirably Offenbach set it to music in the
rippling airs of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Grande Duchesse</i>, which
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout Paris</i> then whistled and sang!</p>

<p>I think the sun in those days shone all
the time, and Paris, newly rebuilt by Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Haussman, glittered in bran new white and
gold under a canopy of silky blue.</p>

<p>Offenbach translated it all&mdash;sunshine,
staring new white stone, gilt railings and
eagles, joyous crowds, laughing women,
madly merry mirlitons, dazzling uniforms,
splendid horses and carriages, imperial
tinsel, bright silk skies, universal carelessness,
recklessness, and intoxication. It is all
in the music of <i>The Grand Duchess of
Gerolstein</i>.</p>

<p>Then the Sunday picnics in the woods of
Vincennes and St. Cloud! the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">al fresco</i>
dinner-parties at the suburban cafés! the
jousting games upon the river, where we
knocked each other into the Seine, to the
joy of ourselves and all beholders! and the
old dances&mdash;ah! who could forget the
dances of the fête at St. Cloud? Men in
shirt-sleeves, girls without hats, spinning like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a><br /><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
coupled tornadoes, heedless of time, heedless
of all measure, heedless of conventions. If
they desired to dance the waltz, and the band
chose to play the polka, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eh bien</i>, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Zut</i>," to
the band.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="champs" id="champs"></a>
<img src="images/p219.jpg" width="450" height="511" alt="champs" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And the band! If the dancers didn't
care, it was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien égal</i> to the band? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu.</i>
Every blower blew his hardest, and arranged
his time to his heart's content; every scraper
scraped for novelty of effect, letting harmony
take care of itself; and the drummer in his
shirt-sleeves, contemptuous of all besides,
spanked the sounding drum with a rollicking
energy that put all other effects in the shade.
How he did drum, that drummer! and
smile, and cock his hat!</p>

<p>Then the great Exhibition of 1867, and
my childish wonder and delight in its
cosmopolitan crowds and dazzling prodigality
of uniforms! By the same token I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that my first literary attempt was a composition
written at M. Duvernoy's Protestant
School, in the Rue Madame, setting forth
my impressions of a grand review upon a
brilliant Sunday in the Bois de Boulogne,
where three emperors and the Sultan of
Turkey watched the man&oelig;uvres of what was
then believed to be the finest army in the
world; and I remember&mdash;these little things
cling to one's memory sometimes to the
exclusion of important events&mdash;how the
Prince Imperial, Napoleon's ill-starred son,
riding past our landau at the head of his
glittering regiment in the Avenue de
l'Impératrice, paused to smile at me, a boy
little younger than himself, as my hat's
protecting elastic hindered my salute.</p>

<p>Yet another radiant Sunday I remember,
and a splendid cavalcade escorting
Napoleon III, and the Sultan from the Palais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
de l'Industrie back through the Champs-Élysées
through the then spick and span,
and glitteringly white Rue de Rivoli, to the
luxurious Palais des Tuileries; and I
remember how amongst the hurrahs and
waving of hats, there burst out one loud
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A bas l'Empereur</i>," which caused the
conqueror of Solferino to look furtively
sideways under his heavy eyebrows, whilst
his ubiquitous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mouchards</i> pounced upon the
bold republican with their loaded sticks and
dragged him off to jail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But now when I visit Paris I see no more
the pomp and glitter of unsurpassed
opulence, nor splendour of architecture, nor
infectious gaiety.</p>

<p>Scowling St. Antoine I see all the time&mdash;in
the bullet marks left on the buildings
from the Commune massacre, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
faces and gait of the tired and melancholy
Parisians.</p>

<p>The glitter of Haussman's buildings is
faded, their whiteness tarnished, the whole
place is like the scene of an orgie as seen by
the revellers on the dismal morrow.</p>

<p>The books and pictures in the shop
windows are infamous; the plays in theatres
and music-halls are unspeakable; and the
smells&mdash;ah, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu?</i> the smells!</p>

<p>Looked Paris so in '70? and smelt so?
Pah!</p>

<p>My acquaintance with atmospheres is
extensive and peculiar. I have essayed
Widnes on a summer's afternoon; I have
sniffed the fiery soot, smithy cleek, and
wheel swarf of Sheffield in August; I have
dwelt upon the fragrant banks of Irwell and
within scent of Barking Creek; but&mdash;a
sultry day in Paris, ugh!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The narrow streets near the Halles may
not smell as strong as St. Helen's, nor as
loud as Widnes, but their perfume is more
subtle, and like the famous patent pill of
England it goes further.</p>

<p>When the hot season begins, people who
regularly live thereabouts need no nutriment.</p>

<p>They live on the atmosphere&mdash;or die on
it. And the state of the latter is the more
happy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the drapers' shops.</p>

<p>How is it that in the years that were
earlier, I saw only fêtes and picnics? whilst
now, when I accompany my Bosom's Lord
on her periodical invasions of France&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! yes, perhaps that accounts for it.</p>

<p>I accompany Madame to the Printemps,
the Belle Jardinière, the Louvre, and the
Bon Marché, to interpret her commands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and I climb everlasting staircases like a little
white mouse in a wheel.</p>

<p>How I perspire&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dame!</i> how I perspire!</p>

<p>One day in a great magazine of Paris a
small grease spot will be found upon the
carpet, and someone will approach and
say, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens donc</i>, this grease spot; what
is it?"</p>

<p>And they will call Mr. Stirlock Roames,
the detective, and he will say, "Ah, it is the
remains of a great dramatic critic. By my
process of induction I perceive that he was a
remarkable genius, and owned a yellow dog
with a gift for solo leapfrog. He had one
fault: he was too good. If you bring me a
small piece of blotting-paper and a flat iron
I will pick him up."</p>

<p>And the grease spot will be removed to
Westminster Abbey, and the readers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<cite>Clarion</cite> will wear sackcloth and ashes ever
after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ah! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu!</i> These shops!</p>

<p>"Ask the man," says She who must be
obeyed, "to show me an accordeon-pleated
plain bell-skirt with a deep hem and shallow
basque of glycine velvet, shirred with a
shallow round yoke of fine guise guipure,
and broadly turned back lapels of material
to match, and ample Marie Stuart sleeves of
white satin mounted on lace, braceleted with
a band of silver and pearl-embroidered satin
slashed to the elbow."</p>

<p>A college of professors of languages,
armed with a library of technical dictionaries
would be compelled to give it up.</p>

<p>But I dare not.</p>

<p>If I confessed myself unable to translate
this wholesale order offhand into current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Parisian, Madame would denounce me as
an impostor on the spot.</p>

<p>Therefore I translate it for her, but I work
it on a system. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>I turn nonchalantly to the shopman, and
observe briskly in French, "Of all sad words
of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, it
might have been."</p>

<p>Madame, who doesn't understand a word,
nods her head in corroboration like a
Chinese figure in a tea-shop window, and
repeats "Wee-wee," which, as regards
French, represents the whole of her little
lot.</p>

<p>Whatever the topic, whatever the emergency,
she always says "Wee-wee." One
would think that sometimes when she had
laid it out in one speculation unsuccessfully,
she would feel discouraged and deterred.</p>

<p>But lor! nothing discourages that diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but remarkable woman. I have tried,
and I know.</p>

<p>So whenever, in Paris, opportunity occurs
to put in a word, Madame sails in hopefully
and spreads out her "Wee-wee" as confidently
as if it were the ace of trumps.</p>

<p>Whereupon the shopman looks perplexed.
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, M'sieur</i>," says he, shrugging his
shoulders in pretty apology, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je ne comprends
pas</i>."</p>

<p>It is a shame to abuse his gentle, smiling
good-nature and affability, but, what the good
year! self-preservation is the first law of
Nature. My business at this crisis is not to
bandy compliments with a polite shopman,
but to snatch my acquisitive Bosom's Lord
as swiftly as it may be from bankruptcy.</p>

<p>When the shopman says he does not
understand me, I pepper him at once with
another staggerer. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Milles bombes!</i>" I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
cry, "what have you done with M.
Zola?"</p>

<p>"M. Zola!" he exclaims, looking pathetically
bewildered; "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vraiment, M'sieur</i>, I do
not know."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," I answer meditatively.
Then, turning to Madame, I explain: "Sold
out. Empress of China sent for the last
this morning. Fresh cargo expected from
Patagonia in the spring"; and hastily grabbing
her umbrella I snatch her out of the
shop before she can say "Wee-wee."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It worked very well at first. Then she
got in the way of grabbing her umbrella in
her own hand at the critical moment, and
when I turned to go she would say, "Yes, I
know what you are going to say, my dear;
they're sold out again. It must be, as you
suggest, the curious custom of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
But do not be discouraged; ask him
whether they have any alpaca skirts with
dotted foulards in two-inch wristbands of
shot moiré gussets and squashed strawberry
ruchings to the sleeve, rosettes of
guipure and bronze-powdered swordgrass
flounces with Imogen ruffles round the
waist."</p>

<p>Then the situation complicates itself; it
becomes needful to prepare the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand coup</i>.</p>

<p>I approach the shopman with a determined
air, and with faltering speech, and eyes that
wildly glare; I give it him in French, as
thus&mdash;"Look at here, young fellow, unaccustomed
as I am to public speaking, I
say that drink is a curse."</p>

<p>He looks surprised, and shrugs his
shoulders again as if once more to
apologise.</p>

<p>"Then bandy words no more with me," I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
cry; "for slaves cannot breathe in England;
if their lungs receive our air, that moment
they are free; they touch our country and
their shackles fall."</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, M'sieur</i>," he begins, but ere he
can think of his little piece, I pour into him
another broadside&mdash;"O native isle," I cry,
adopting now a friendly, engaging, and
rhapsodical air, "fair freedom's happiest
seat! at thought of thee, my bounding pulses
beat! For what country has such work-houses,
such gin-palaces, such company
promoters, such Sunday clothes, and such
respectability?"</p>

<p>He shakes his head, a little impatiently
perhaps, and again begins, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais, M'sieur</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you would plead," I
interrupt, "but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milles tonnerres!</i> is not
your proprietor a lanthern-jawed, spider-legged,
hump-backed, knock-kneed, flat-footed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
swivel-eyed, chowder-headed old
Paty du Clam?"</p>

<p>Then his politeness gives way and the
poison begins to work on him. He foams
at the mouth and jerks out little broken bits
of hissing and gurgling words.</p>

<p>"Come, come," I continue in a placid and
wheedling tone, "you must admit his eyebrows
are like birds' nests, his teeth like
tombstones, and his hair like whiskers on
broomstick. Now, even at his time of life,
why should he not try to wash himself?"</p>

<p>That lets my poor friend out. He rolls
his eyes, claws the air, and spits fire, till at
last my Bosom's Lord, who has been unconsciously
smiling and dropping bland
"Wee-wee's" at ill-sorted intervals throughout
the conversation, imperiously demands
to know what is the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" I explain; "only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
gentleman wants to know whether you are
a Kaffir collector of curiosities or a Hottentot
marine store-dealer, that you should ask for
a thing so many years behind the fashion.
He says you've no more notion of style, my
Queen, than a superannuated Dutch scarecrow
with cheap false teeth and a father who
worked for his living. He says"&mdash;</p>

<p>But that lets <em>her</em> out. She turns upon the
gasping foreigner as if with a view to fell him,
but realising at last the pathetic inadequacy
of "Wee-wee" as a conversational medium,
she speechlessly grabs her umbrella, and with
eyes flashing lightning, rustles out.</p>

<p>As she is too excited to notice me, I
seize the opportunity to apologise to the
shopman.</p>

<p>I explain to him that we are English.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he says, shrugging his shoulders.
No further explanation is required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>I have said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seems mean, but no other means may
serve. Once let a woman get a footing in
a Paris draper's shop, and all is lost.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Par example</i>&mdash;to show you the system.
A woman enters one of these vast magazines
where the insidious, perfidious, meretricious
merchandise of Paris is displayed on countless
counters, in storey after storey.</p>

<p>Suppose, after sampling all the stock,
she asks for a ha'pennyworth of pins:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha'porth o' pins? Oui, madame," says
the shopman. "Would madame deign to
give the address to which I must send
them? No, madame, it is not worth the
trouble to pay now. If you desire to pay,
why not pay when the goods are delivered,
madame?"</p>

<p>And, bowing madame out of the shop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he politely sweeps the floor with his
hair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the next day the pins are delivered
at Madame's address in the suburbs, by
two handsome men in uniform who drive
out in a handsome van. Madame uses
the pins for a few days, and decides that
she can do without them.</p>

<p>Next time she passes that way she calls
in the shop, visits the refreshment department,
where refreshments are dispensed free
of charge, lolls awhile on a sofa in the
reading-room, where the newspapers are kept
for the use of customers, retires to the
writing-room, conducts her day's correspondence
on stationery provided by the
establishment, and finally, as she is passing
out, informs the cashier that she has bought
something which she desires to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oui, madame," says he, "what address?"</p>

<p>She gives her address, and the shop-walker,
as he bows her out, sweeps the
floor with his nose.</p>

<p>Next day come the two handsome men
in uniform with the handsome carriage, to
fetch the pins; on the day following they
come once more to return the money, and
when the lady has pocketed her halfpenny
again, they politely raise their caps and
say, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci bien, Madame.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is the natural result of these things?
When a Parisian wife is not foraging in the
shops, she is in her bedroom trying on
the plunder. She has all the new fashions
sent home to her, tries them on, and
sends half of them back. The other half,
which she never would have seen but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
this tempting convenience, are kept and
have to be paid for.</p>

<p>It is thus that Parisian husbands are
reminded of their wives' existence. If it
were not for the bills, I think some of
them might sometimes forget that they were
married.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It occurred the other day, that my interpretation
of the French failed of its
accustomed success.</p>

<p>At Madame's request, I had asked a
shopwoman at the Samaritaine, the price
of a pennyworth of ribbon; but, after I had
spoken, Madame demanded to know what
I had said.</p>

<p>"I asked her, my Queen, what was the
price?"</p>

<p>"Price of what? Price of a kiss?"</p>

<p>"No, my Sultana; price of the ribbon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was it you said about a kiss?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mention a kiss, my Empress."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did; I heard you."</p>

<p>"No, my Juno, I said, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu'est ce que
c'est?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah? 'Kiss Kissay.' That was what
I heard. How do you spell it?"</p>

<p>She produces a pocket dictionary, with
whose aid she designs during the next
few days to learn the French language, and
I am obliged to spell out my remark while
she dubiously translates it word for word.
The literal translation comes out thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">French</span>&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu'est ce que c'est?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">English</span>&mdash;<i>What is this, what this is?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"'What is this, what this is'?" Madame
solemnly repeats; "is that all you said to
the girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, it is a 'French idiom.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad," says she, "that it is no
worse. It is a mercy I did not let you
come to this place by yourself.</p>

<p>"Let us get home to London."</p>

<p>And I am thankful to be able to add
that we get.</p>
